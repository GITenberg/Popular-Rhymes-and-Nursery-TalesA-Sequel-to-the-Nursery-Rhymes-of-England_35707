<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id127">PREFACE.</a></h1>
<p>It were greatly to be desired that the instructors of our children could
be persuaded how much is lost by rejecting the venerable relics of
nursery traditional literature, and substituting in their place the
present cold, unimaginative,—I had almost said, unnatural,—prosaic
good-boy stories. &quot;In the latter case,&quot; observes Sir Walter Scott,
&quot;their minds are, as it were, put into the stocks, like their feet at
the dancing-school, and the moral always consists in good conduct being
crowned with success. Truth is, I would not give one tear shed over
Little Red Riding Hood for all the benefit to be derived from a hundred
histories of Jemmy Goodchild. I think the selfish tendencies will be
soon enough acquired in this arithmetical age; and that, to make the
higher class of character, our own wild fictions—like our own simple
music—will have more effect in awakening the fancy and elevating the
disposition, than the colder and more elaborate compositions of modern
authors and composers.&quot;</p>
<p>Deeply impressed with this truth, and firmly convinced of the
&quot;imagination-nourishing&quot; power of the wild and fanciful lore of the old
nursery, I have spared no labour in collecting the fragments which have
been traditionally preserved in our provinces. The object is not so much
to present to the reader a few literary trifles, though even their
curiosity and value in several important discussions must not be
despised, as to rescue in order to restore; a solemn recompense due from
literature for having driven them away; and to recall the memory to
early associations, in the hope that they who love such recollections
will not suffer the objects of them to disappear with the present
generation.</p>
<p>In arranging the materials gathered for this little volume, I have
followed, in some respects, the plan adopted by Mr. Robert Chambers, in
his elegant work, the Popular Rhymes of Scotland; but our vernacular
anthology will be found to contain so much which does not occur in any
shape in that of the sister country, that the two collections have not
as much similarity as might have been expected. Together, they will
eventually contain nearly all that is worth preserving of what may be
called the natural literature of Great Britain. Mr. Chambers, indeed,
may be said to have already exhausted the subject for his own land in
the last edition of his interesting publication, but no systematic
attempt has yet been made in the same direction for this country; and
although the curiosity and extent of the relics I have been enabled to
collect have far exceeded my expectations, I am fully aware how much
more can yet be accomplished. An additional number of foreign synonymes
could also no doubt be collected; though perhaps more easily by
foreigners, for Continental works which contain notices of traditional
literature are procured with difficulty in England. The following pages,
however, contain sufficient of these to exhibit the striking
similarities between rhymes prevalent over England, and others which
exist in the North of Europe.</p>
<p>The collection of Nursery Tales is not as extensive as could have been
wished, but the difficulty of procuring the brief traditional stories
which were current some century since, now for the most part only
recollected in obscure districts, is so great, that no apology is
necessary for the apparent deficiency of that section. The few which
have been obtained are of considerable curiosity and interest; and I
would venture to suggest to all readers of these pages the great
obligation they would confer by the communication of any additions.
Stories of this kind are undoubtedly to be obtained from oral tradition,
and perhaps some of literary importance may yet be recovered.</p>
<p>The compiler's best thanks are due to Captain Henry Smith for the very
interesting communication of rhymes current in the Isle of Wight; to
Mr. George Stephens for several curious fragments, and valuable
references to Swedish songs; and to many kind correspondents who have
furnished me with rhymes current in the various districts in which they
reside. It is only by a large provincial correspondence that a
collection of this kind can be rendered complete, and the minutest
information on any of our popular tales or rhymes, forwarded to the
address given below, would be most thankfully and carefully
acknowledged.</p>

<div class="section" id="i-nursery-antiquities">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id128">I.—NURSERY ANTIQUITIES.</a></h1>
<p>Although the names of Scott and Grimm may be enumerated amongst the
writers who have acknowledged the ethnological and philosophic value of
traditional nursery literature, it is difficult to impress on the public
mind the importance of a subject apparently in the last degree trifling
and insignificant, or to induce an opinion that the jingles and simple
narratives of a garrulous nurse can possess a worth beyond the circle of
their own immediate influence.</p>
<p>But they who despise the humbler sources of literary illustration must
be content to be told, and hereafter to learn, that traces of the
simplest stories and most absurd superstitions are often more effectual
in proving the affinity of different races, and determining other
literary questions, than a host of grander and more imposing monuments.
The history of fiction is continually efficacious in discussions of this
kind, and the identities of puerile sayings frequently answer a similar
purpose. Both, indeed, are of high value. The humble chap-book is found
to be descended not only from medieval romance, but also not
unfrequently from the more ancient mythology, whilst some of our
simplest nursery-rhymes are chanted to this day by the children of
Germany, Denmark, and Sweden, a fact strikingly exhibiting their great
antiquity and remote origin.</p>
<p>The subject, however curious and interesting, is far too diffuse to be
investigated at any length in a work like the present; and, indeed, the
materials are for the most part so scattered and difficult of access,
that it would require the research of many years to accomplish the task
satisfactorily. I shall, then, content myself with indicating a few of
the most striking analogies between the rhymes of foreign countries and
those of our own, for this portion of the inquiry has been scarcely
alluded to by my predecessors. With regard to the tales, a few notices
of their antiquity will be found in the prefaces or notes to the stories
themselves, and few readers will require to be informed that
Whittington's cat realized his price in India, and that Arlotto related
the story long before the Lord Mayor was born; that Jack the
Giant-killer is founded on an Edda; or that the slipper of Cinderella
finds a parallel in the history of the celebrated Rhodope. To enter into
these discussions would be merely to repeat an oft-told tale, and I
prefer offering a few notes which will be found to possess a little more
novelty.</p>
<p>Of the many who must recollect the nursery jingles of their youth, how
few in number are those who have suspected their immense age, or that
they were ever more than unmeaning nonsense; far less that their
creation belongs to a period before that at which the authentic records
of our history commence. Yet there is no exaggeration in such a
statement. We find the same trifles which erewhile lulled or amused the
English infant, are current in slightly varied forms throughout the
North of Europe; we know that they have been sung in the northern
countries for centuries, and that there has been no modern outlet for
their dissemination across the German Ocean. The most natural inference
is to adopt the theory of a Teutonic origin, and thus give to every
genuine child-rhyme, found current in England and Sweden, an immense
antiquity. There is nothing improbable in the supposition, for the
preservation of the relics of primitive literature often bears an
inverse ratio to their importance. Thus, for example, a well-known
English nursery rhyme tells us,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">There was an old man,</div>
<div class="line">And he had a calf,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And that's half;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">He took him out of the stall,</div>
<div class="line">And put him on the wall,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And that's all.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>A composition apparently of little interest or curiosity; but Arwidsson,
unacquainted with the English rhyme, produces the following as current
in Sweden, Svenska Fornsånger, iii. 488, which bears far too striking a
similarity to the above to have had a different origin,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Gubben och gumman hade en kalf,</div>
<div class="line">Och nu är visan half!</div>
<div class="line">Och begge så körde de halfven i vall,</div>
<div class="line">Och nu är visan all!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>We could not, perhaps, select a better instance of this kind of
similarity in nepial songs as current throughout the great northern
states of Europe than the pretty stanza on the ladybird. Variations of
this familiar song belong to the vernacular literature of England,
Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. The version at present current in the
North of England is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lady-cow, lady-cow, fly thy way home,</div>
<div class="line">Thy house is on fire, thy children all gone;</div>
<div class="line">All but one that ligs under a stone,</div>
<div class="line">Fly thee home, lady-cow, ere it be gone! <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id2" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td><p class="first">In Norfolk the lady-bird is called <em>burny-bee</em>,
and the following lines are current:</p>
<div class="last line-block">
<div class="line">Burnie bee, burnie bee,</div>
<div class="line">Tell me when your wedding be.</div>
<div class="line">If it be to-morrow day,</div>
<div class="line">Take your wings and fly away.</div>
</div>
</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These lines are said by children, when they throw the beautiful little
insect into the air, to make it take flight. Two Scottish variations are
given by Mr. Chambers, p. 170. In Germany it is called the Virgin Mary's
chafer, <em>Marienwürmchen</em>, or the May-chafer, <em>Maikäferchen</em>, or the
gold-bird, <em>Guldvogel</em>. In Sweden, gold-hen, gold-cow, or the Virgin
Mary's maid. In Denmark, our Lord's hen, or our Lady's hen. We may first
mention the German song translated by Taylor as frequently alluded to by
writers on this subject. The second verse is the only one preserved in
England.</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="line">Come sit on my finger, so happy and gay;</div>

</div>
<div class="line">No harm would I do thee, no foeman is near,</div>

<p>In Des Knaben Wunderhorn, Arnim und Brentano, 1808, iii. 82, 83, 90, we
have three German songs relating to the lady-bird. The first two of
these are here given:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Der Guldvogel.</em></div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Guldvogel, flieg aus,</div>
<div class="line">Flieg auf die Stangen,</div>
<div class="line">Käsebrode langen;</div>
<div class="line">Mir eins, dir eins,</div>
<div class="line">Alle gute G'sellen eins.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Gold-bird, get thee gone, fly to thy perch, bring cheese-cakes, one for
me, one for thee, and one for all good people.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Maikäferchen, Maikäferchen, fliege weg!</div>
<div class="line">Dein Häusgen brennt,</div>
<div class="line">Dein Mütterchen flennt,</div>
<div class="line">Dein Vater sitzt auf der Schwelle,</div>
<div class="line">Flieg in Himmel aus der Hölle.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;May-bird, May-bird, fly away. Thy house burns, thy mother weeps, thy
father stays at his threshold, fly from hell into heaven!&quot;—The third is
not so similar to our version. Another German one is given in Kuhn und
Schwark, Norddeutsche Sagen, 1848, p. 375:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Maikäferchen, fliege,</div>
<div class="line">Dein Vater ist im Kriege,</div>
<div class="line">Dein Mutter ist in Pommerland,</div>
<div class="line">Pommerland ist abgebrannt!</div>
<div class="line">Maikäferchen, fliege.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;May-bird, fly. Thy father is in the war, thy mother is in Pomerania,
Pomerania is burnt! May-bird, fly.&quot;—See, also, Erk und Irmer, Die
Deutschen Volkslieder, Berlin, 1839, iv. 7, Das Maikäferlied. For the
two pretty Swedish songs which follow I am indebted to the MS. of Mr.
Stephens. The first is common in the southern parts of that country, the
other in the northern.</p>

<p>Accumulative tales are of very high antiquity. The original of &quot;the
House that Jack Built&quot; is well known to be an old Hebrew hymn in Sepher
Haggadah. It is also found in Danish, but in a somewhat shorter form;
(See Thiele, Danske Folkesagn, II. iii. 146, <em>Der har du det Huus som
Jacob bygde</em>;) and the English version is probably very old, as may be
inferred from the mention of &quot;the priest all shaven and shorn.&quot; A
version of the old woman and her sixpence occurs in the same collection,
II. iv. 161, <em>Konen och Grisen Fick</em>, the old wife and her piggy
Fick,—&quot;There was once upon a time an old woman who had a little pig
hight Fick, who would never go home late in the evening. So the old
woman said to her stick:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">'Stick, beat Fick, I say!</div>
<div class="line">Piggie will not go home to-day!'&quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This chant-tale is also common in Sweden. One copy has been printed by
N. Lilja in his Violen en Samling Jullekar, Barnsånger och Sagor, i. 20,
<em>Gossen och Geten Näppa</em>, the boy and the goat Neppa,—&quot;There was once a
yeoman who had a goat called Neppa, but Neppa would never go home from
the field. The yeoman was therefore forced to promise his daughter in
marriage to whoever could get Neppa home. Many tried their fortune in
vain, but at last a sharp boy offered to ward the goat. All the next day
he followed Neppa, and when evening came, he said, 'Now will we
homeward go?' but Neppa answered, 'Pluck me a tuft or so,'&quot; &amp;c. The
story is conducted in an exactly similar manner in which the
<em>dénoûement</em> is brought about in the English tale. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id7">[4]</a></p>

<p>The well-known song of &quot;There was a lady lov'd a swine,&quot; is found in an

Bodl. 30:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>A similar song is current in Sweden, as we learn from Arwidsson, Svenska
Fornsånger, iii. 482, who gives a version in which an old woman, who had
no children, took a little foal, which she called Longshanks, and rocked
and nursed it as if it had been her own child: <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id9">[5]</a></p>

<p>Another paradoxical song-tale, respecting the old woman who went to
market, and had her petticoats cut off at her knees &quot;by a pedlar whose
name was Stout,&quot; is found in some shape or other in most countries in
Europe. A Norwegian version is given by Asbjörnsen og Moe, Norske
Folkeeventyr, 1843, and, if I recollect rightly, it is also found in
Grimm.</p>
<p>The riddle-rhyme of &quot;Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall&quot; is, in one form or
other, a favorite throughout Europe. A curious Danish version is given
by Thiele, iii. 148:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lille Trille</div>
<div class="line">Laae paa Hylde;</div>
<div class="line">Lille Trille</div>
<div class="line">Faldt ned af Hylde.</div>
<div class="line">Ingen Mand</div>
<div class="line">I hele Land</div>
<div class="line">Lille Trille curere kan.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Which may be thus translated:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Little Trille</div>
<div class="line">Lay on a shelf:</div>
<div class="line">Little Trille</div>
<div class="line">Thence pitch'd himself:</div>
<div class="line">Not all the men</div>
<div class="line">In our land, I ken,</div>
<div class="line">Can put Little Trille right again.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And Mr. Stephens has preserved two copies in his MS. Swedish
collections. The first is from the province of Upland:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Thille Lille</div>
<div class="line-block">

<div class="line">Never a leech the world can show</div>

<p>Another from the province of Småland:</p>

<div class="line">Lille Bulle rolled;</div>
<div class="line">Never a man in all this land</div>
<div class="line">Lille Bulle helpen can.</div>

</blockquote>
<p>It will now only be necessary to refer to the similarities pointed out
in other parts of this work, to convince the reader that, at all events,
a very fair case is made out for the truth of the positions we have
contended for, if, indeed, sufficient evidence of their absolute truth
is not adduced. They who are accustomed to researches of this kind, are
too well aware of the facility with which the most plausible theories
are frequently nullified by subsequent discovery; but there appears in
the present case to be numerous conditions insoluble by any other
supposition than that of a common origin, and we are therefore fully
justified in adopting it as proved.</p>
<p>Turning to the nursery rhymes of our own country, it will tend
materially to strengthen the results to which we have arrived, if we
succeed in proving their antiquity in this island. We shall be enabled
to do so satisfactorily, and to show that they are not the modern
nonsense some folks may pronounce them to be. They illustrate the
history and manners of the people for centuries. Here, for instance, is
a relic in the form of a nursery rhyme, but in reality part of a
political song, referring to the rebellious times of Richard the
Second. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id11">[6]</a></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Political nursery-rhymes, or rather political rhymes of a jingling
character, which, losing their original application, are preserved only
in the nursery, were probably common in the seventeenth century. The two
just quoted have evidently an historical application. The manuscript
miscellanies of the time of James I. and Charles I. contain several
copies of literal rhymes not very unlike &quot;A, B, C, tumble-down D.&quot; In
the reign of Charles II. political pasquinades constantly partook of
the genuine nursery character. We may select the following example, of
course put into the mouth of that sovereign, preserved in MS. Douce 357,
f. 124, in the Bodleian Library:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">See-saw, sack-a-day;</div>
<div class="line">Monmouth is a pretie boy,</div>

<div class="line">Grafton is my onely joy,</div>
<div class="line">And why should I these three destroy</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To please a pious brother?</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;What is the rhyme for porringer?&quot; was written on occasion of the
marriage of Mary, the daughter of James Duke of York, afterwards James
II., with the young Prince of Orange: and the following alludes to
William III. and George Prince of Denmark:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">William and Mary, George and Anne,</div>
<div class="line">Four such children had never a man:</div>
<div class="line">They put their father to flight and shame,</div>
<div class="line">And call'd their brother a shocking bad name.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Another nursery song on King William is not yet obsolete, but its
application is not generally known. My authority is the title of it in
MS. Harl. 7316:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">As I walk'd by myself,</div>
<div class="line">And talked to myself,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Myself said unto me,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Look to thyself,</div>
<div class="line">Take care of thyself,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For nobody cares for thee.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">I answer'd myself,</div>
<div class="line">And said to myself</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In the self-same repartee,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Look to thyself,</div>
<div class="line">Or not look to thyself,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The self-same thing will be.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>To this class of rhymes I may add the following on Dr. Sacheverel,
which was obtained from oral tradition:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Doctor Sacheverel</div>
<div class="line">Did very well,</div>
<div class="line">But Jacky Dawbin</div>
<div class="line">Gave him a warning.</div>

<p>When there are no allusions to guide us, it is only by accident that we
can hope to test the history and antiquity of these kind of scraps, but
we have no doubt whatever that many of them are centuries old. The
following has been traced to the time of Henry VI., a singular doggerel,
the joke of which consists in saying it so quickly that it cannot be
told whether it is English or gibberish:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In fir tar is,</div>
<div class="line">In oak none is,</div>
<div class="line">In mud eel is,</div>
<div class="line">In clay none is,</div>

<p>&quot;Multiplication is vexation,&quot; a painful reality to schoolboys, was found
a few years ago in a manuscript dated 1570; and the memorial lines,
&quot;Thirty days hath September,&quot; occur in the Return from Parnassus, an old
play printed in 1606. Our own reminiscences of such matters, and those
of Shakespeare, may thus have been identical! &quot;To market, to market, to
buy a plum-bun,&quot; is partially quoted in Florio's New World of Words,
1611, in v. 'Abómba.' The old song of the &quot;Carrion Crow sat on an Oak,&quot;
was discovered by me in MS. Sloane 1489, of the time of Charles I., but
under a different form:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Hic, hoc, the carrion crow,</div>
<div class="line">For I have shot something too low:</div>
<div class="line">I have quite missed my mark,</div>
<div class="line">And shot the poor sow to the heart;</div>
<div class="line">Wife, bring treacle in a spoon,</div>
<div class="line">Or else the poor sow's heart will down.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Sing a song of sixpence&quot; is quoted by Beaumont and Fletcher. &quot;Buz,
quoth the blue fly,&quot; which is printed in the nursery halfpenny books,
belongs to Ben Jonson's Masque of Oberon; the old ditty of &quot;Three Blind
Mice&quot; is found in the curious music book entitled Deuteromelia, or the
Second Part of Musicke's Melodie, 1609; and the song, &quot;When I was a
little girl, I wash'd my mammy's dishes,&quot; is given by Aubrey in MS.
Lansd. 231. &quot;A swarm of bees in May,&quot; is quoted by Miege, 1687. And so
on of others, fragments of old catches and popular songs being
constantly traced in the apparently unmeaning rhymes of the nursery.</p>
<p>Most of us have heard in time past the school address to a story-teller:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Liar, liar, lick dish,</div>
<div class="line">Turn about the candlestick.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Not very important lines, one would imagine, but they explain a passage
in Chettle's play of the Tragedy of Hoffman, or a Revenge for a Father,
4to. Lond, 1631, which would be partially inexplicable without such
assistance:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>Lor.</em> By heaven! it seemes hee did, but all was vaine;</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The flinty rockes had cut his tender scull,</div>
<div class="line">And the rough water wash't away his braine.</div>
</div>
<div class="line"><em>Luc.</em> Lyer, lyer, licke dish!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The intention of the last speaker is sufficiently intelligible, but a
future editor, anxious to investigate his author minutely, might search
in vain for an explanation of <em>licke dish</em>. Another instance <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id16" id="id15">[8]</a> of the
antiquity of children's rhymes I met with lately at Stratford-on-Avon,
in a MS. of the seventeenth century, in the collection of the late
Captain James Saunders, where, amongst common-place memoranda on more
serious subjects, written about the year 1630, occurred a version of
one of our most favorite nursery songs:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I had a little bonny nagg,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">His name was Dapple Gray;</div>

<p>It is not improbable that Shakespeare, who has alluded so much and so
intricately to the vernacular rural literature of his day, has more
notices of nursery-rhymes and tales than research has hitherto elicited.
I am only acquainted with one reference to the former, &quot;Pillicock sat on
Pillicock hill,&quot; which is quoted by Edgar in King Lear, iii. 4, and is
found in Gammer Gurton's Garland, and in most modern collections of
English nursery-rhymes. The secret meaning is not very delicate, nor is
it necessary to enter into any explanation on the subject. It may,
however, be worthy of remark, that the term <em>pillicock</em> is found in a
manuscript (Harl. 913) in the British Museum of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>English children accompanied their amusements with trivial verses from a
very early period, but as it is only by accident that any allusions to
them have been made, it is difficult to sustain the fact by many
examples. The Nomenclator or Remembrancer of Adrianus Junius, translated
by Higins, and edited by Fleming, 8vo. 1585, contains a few notices of
this kind; p. 298, &quot;βασιλινδα, the playe called one penie, one
penie, come after me; χυτρινδα, the play called selling of
peares, or how many plums for a penie; p. 299, χοινοφιλινδα,
a kinde of playe called</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Clowt, clowt,</div>
<div class="line">To beare about,</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>or my hen hath layd; ιποστρακισμος, a kind of sport or play
with an oister shell or a stone throwne into the water, and making
circles yer it sinke, &amp;c.; it is called,</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A ducke and a drake,</div>
<div class="line">And a halfe penie cake.&quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This last notice is particularly curious, for similar verses are used by
boys at the present day at the game of water-skimming. The amusement
itself is very ancient, and a description of it may be seen in Minucius
Felix, Lugd. Bat. 1652, p. 3. There cannot be a doubt but that many of
the inexplicable nonsense-rhymes of our nursery belonged to antique
recreations, but it is very seldom their original application can be
recovered. The well-known doggerel respecting the tailor of Bicester may
be mentioned as a remarkable instance of this, for it is one of the most
common nursery-rhymes of the present day, and Aubrey, MS. Lansd. 231,
writing in the latter part of the seventeenth century, preserved it as
part of the formula of a game called <em>leap-candle</em>. &quot;The young girls in
and about Oxford have a sport called Leap-Candle, for which they set a
candle in the middle of the room in a candlestick, and then draw up
their coats into the form of breaches, and dance over the candle back
and forth, with these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The tailor of Biciter,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">He has but one eye,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">He cannot cut a pair of green galagaskins,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">If he were to die.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This sport in other parts is called <em>Dancing the Candle Rush</em>.&quot; It may be
necessary to observe that <em>galagaskins</em> were wide loose trousers.</p>
<p>The rhyme of Jack Horner has been stated to be a satire on the
Puritanical aversion to Christmas pies and suchlike abominations. It
forms part of a metrical chap-book history, founded on the same story as
the Friar and the Boy, entitled &quot;The Pleasant History of Jack Horner,
containing his witty tricks, and pleasant pranks, which he played from
his youth to his riper years: right pleasant and delightful for winter
and summer's recreation,&quot; embellished with frightful woodcuts, which
have not much connexion with the tale. The pleasant history commences as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Jack Horner was a pretty lad,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Near London he did dwell,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">His father's heart he made full glad,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">His mother lov'd him well.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">While little Jack was sweet and young,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">If he by chance should cry,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">His mother pretty sonnets sung,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">With a lul-la-ba-by,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">With such a dainty curious tone,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">As Jack sat on her knee,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">So that, e'er he could go alone,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">He sung as well as she.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">A pretty boy of curious wit,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">All people spoke his praise,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And in the corner would he sit</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In Christmas holydays.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">When friends they did together meet,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To pass away the time—</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Why, little Jack, he sure would eat</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">His Christmas pie in rhyme.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And said, Jack Horner, in the corner,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Eats good Christmas pie,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And with his thumbs pulls out the plumbs,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And said, Good boy am I!</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have an important discovery! Who before suspected that the
nursery-rhyme was written by Jack Horner himself?</p>
<p>Few children's rhymes are more common than those relating to Jack Sprat
and his wife, &quot;Jack Sprat could eat no fat,&quot; &amp;c.; but it is little
thought they have been current for two centuries. Such, however, is the
fact, and when Howell published his collection of Proverbs in 1659, p.
20, the story related to no less exalted a personage than an archdeacon:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Archdeacon Pratt would eat no fatt,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">His wife would eat no lean;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">'Twixt Archdeacon Pratt and Joan his wife,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The meat was eat up clean.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>On the same page of this collection we find the commencement of the
rigmarole, &quot;A man of words and not of deeds,&quot; which in the next century
was converted into a burlesque song on the battle of Culloden! <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id20" id="id19">[10]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

<p>The earliest copy of the saying, &quot;A man of words and not of deeds,&quot; I
have hitherto met with, occurs in MS. Harl. 1927, of the time of James
I. Another version, written towards the close of the seventeenth
century, but unfitted for publication, is preserved on the last leaf of
MS. Harl. 6580.</p>
<p>Many of the metrical nonsense-riddles of the nursery are of considerable
antiquity. A collection of conundrums formed early in the seventeenth
century by Randle Holmes, the Chester antiquary, and now preserved in
MS. Harl. 1962, contains several which have been traditionally
remembered up to the present day. Thus we find versions of &quot;Little Nancy
Etticoat in a white petticoat,&quot; &quot;Two legs sat upon three legs,&quot; &quot;As
round as an apple,&quot; and others. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id22" id="id21">[11]</a></p>

<p>During the latter portion of the seventeenth century numerous songs and
games were introduced which were long remembered in the English nursery.
&quot;Questions and Commands&quot; was a common game, played under various systems
of representation. One boy would enact king, and the subjects would give
burlesque answers, e. g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><em>K.</em> King I am!</div>
<div class="line"><em>S.</em> I am your man.</div>
<div class="line"><em>K.</em> What service will you do?</div>
<div class="line"><em>S.</em> The best and worst, and all I can!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>A clever writer in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1738, says this was
played during the Commonwealth in ridicule of sovereignty! He humorously
adds, continually quoting games then current: &quot;During all Oliver's time,
the chief diversion was, 'The parson hath lost his fuddling-cap,' which
needs no explanation. At the Restoration succeeded love-games, as 'I
love my love with an A,' a 'Flower and a lady,' and 'I am a lusty
wooer;' changed in the latter end of this reign, as well as all King
James II.'s, to 'I am come to torment you.' At the Revolution, when all
people recovered their liberty, the children played promiscuously at
what game they liked best. The most favorite one, however, was 'Puss in
the corner.'&quot; The same writer also mentions the game of &quot;I am a Spanish
merchant.&quot;</p>
<p>The following nursery-rhyme is quoted in Parkin's Reply to Dr.
Stukeley's second number of the Origines Roystonianæ, 4to. 1748, p. 6,
but I am not aware that it is still current:—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

<p>The tale of &quot;Old Mother Hubbard&quot; is undoubtedly of some antiquity, were
we merely to judge of the rhyme of <em>laughing</em> to <em>coffin</em> in the third
verse. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id26" id="id23">[12]</a> &quot;There was an old woman toss'd up in a blanket&quot; is supposed
to be the original song of &quot;Lilliburlero, or Old Woman, whither so
high?&quot; the tune to which was published in 1678. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id27" id="id24">[13]</a> &quot;Come, drink old ale
with me,&quot; a nursery catch, with an improper meaning now lost, is found
in MS. Harl. 7332, of the seventeenth century. &quot;Round about, round
about, magotty-pie,&quot; is probably as old, magot-pie being an obsolete
term for a magpie. For a similar reason, the antiquity of &quot;Here am I,
little Jumping Joan,&quot; may be inferred. Jumping Joan was the Cant term
for a lady of little reputation. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id28" id="id25">[14]</a> The well-known riddle, &quot;As I was
going to St. Ives,&quot; occurs in MS. Harl. 7316, of the early part of the
last century; and the following extract from Poor Robin's Almanack for
1693, may furnish us with the original of the celebrated ballad on Tom
of Islington, though the latter buried his troublesome wife on Sunday:
&quot;How one saw a lady on the Saturday, married her on the Sunday, she was
brought to bed on the Monday, the child christened on the Tuesday, it
died on the Wednesday, was buried on the Thursday, the bride's portion
was paid on the Friday, and the bridegroom ran clear away on the
Saturday!&quot;</p>

<p>The antiquity of a rhyme is not unfrequently determined by the use of
an obsolete expression. Thus it may be safely concluded that the common
nursery address to the white moth is no modern composition, from the use
of the term <em>dustipoll</em>, a very old nickname for a miller, which has
long fallen into disuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Millery, millery, dustipoll,</div>
<div class="line">How many sacks have you stole?</div>
<div class="line">Four and twenty and a peck:</div>
<div class="line">Hang the miller up by his neck!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The expression is used by Robin Goodfellow in the old play of Grim, the
Collier of Croydon, first printed in 1662, but written considerably
before that period:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Now, miller, miller, dustipole,</div>

<p>A very curious ballad, written about the year 1720, in the possession of

<p>This ballad is a very important illustration of the history of these
puerile rhymes, for it establishes the fact that some we might aptly

thought such nonsense as,</p>

<p>could have descended in all its purity for several generations, even
although it really may have a deep meaning and an unexceptionable moral?</p>
<p>Having thus, I trust, shown that the nursery has an archæology, the
study of which may eventually lead to important results, the jingles and
songs of our childhood are defended from the imputation of exclusive
frivolity. We may hope that, henceforth, those who have the opportunity
will not consider it a derogatory task to add to these memorials. But
they must hasten to the rescue. The antiquities of the people are
rapidly disappearing before the spread of education; and before many
years have elapsed, they will be lost, or recorded only in the
collections of the antiquary, perhaps requiring evidence that they ever
existed. This is the latest period at which there is a chance of our
arresting their disappearance. If, unfortunately, the most valuable
relics of this kind are wholly lost, many, doubtlessly, remain in the
remote districts sufficiently curious to reward the collector; and it is
to be hoped they will not be allowed to share the fate of Wade and his
boat Guingelot.</p>

<p>The efforts of modern romance are so greatly superior to the best
fictions of a former age, that old wives' tales are not so readily
tolerated as they were in times past. We question whether any one in
these days, save a very grave antiquary, could read two chapters of the
Morte Arthure without a yawn. Let us, then, turn to that simpler class
of narratives which bears the same relation to novels that rural ballads
do to the poem; and ascertain whether the wild interest which, in the
primitive tales erewhile taught by nurse, first awakened our
imagination, can be so reflected as to render their resuscitation
agreeable. We rely a good deal for the success of the experiment on the
power of association; for though these inventions may, in their
character, be suited to the dawn of intellect, they not infrequently
bear the impress of creative fancy, and their imperceptible influence
over the mind does not always evaporate at a later age.</p>
<p>Few persons, indeed, there are, even amongst those who affect to be
insignificantly touched by the imagination, who can be recalled to the
stories and carols that charmed them in their childhood wholly without
emotion. An affectation of indifference in such matters is, of course,
not unusual, for most thoughts springing from early associations, and
those on which so many minds love to dwell, may not be indiscriminately
divulged. It is impossible they should be generally appreciated or
understood. Most of us, however, are liable to be occasionally touched
by allusions breathing of happy days, bearing our memories downward to
behold the shadows of joys that have long passed away like a dream. They
now serve only &quot;to mellow our occasions,&quot; like that &quot;old and antique
song&quot; which relieved the passion of the Duke Orsino.</p>

be said loudly with a start. It was obtained from oral
tradition, and has not, I believe, been printed.]</blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was a teeny-tiny woman lived in a teeny-tiny
house in a teeny-tiny village. Now, one day this teeny-tiny woman put on
her teeny-tiny bonnet, and went out of her teeny-tiny house to take a
teeny-tiny walk. And when this teeny-tiny woman had gone a teeny-tiny
way, she came to a teeny-tiny gate; so the teeny-tiny woman opened the
teeny-tiny gate, and went into a teeny-tiny churchyard. And when this
teeny-tiny woman had got into the teeny-tiny churchyard, she saw a
teeny-tiny bone on a teeny-tiny grave, and the teeny-tiny woman said to
her teeny-tiny self, &quot;This teeny-tiny bone will make me some teeny-tiny
soup for my teeny-tiny supper.&quot; So the teeny-tiny woman put the
teeny-tiny bone into her teeny-tiny pocket, and went home to her
teeny-tiny house.</p>
<p>Now when the teeny-tiny woman got home to her teeny-tiny house, she was
a teeny-tiny tired; so she went up her teeny-tiny stairs to her
teeny-tiny bed, and put the teeny-tiny bone into a teeny-tiny cupboard.
And when this teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep a teeny-tiny time, she
was awakened by a teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard, which
said, &quot;Give me my bone!&quot; And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny
frightened, so she hid her teeny-tiny head under the teeny-tiny clothes,
and went to sleep again. And when she had been to sleep again a
teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny voice again cried out from the
teeny-tiny cupboard a teeny-tiny louder, &quot;Give me my bone!&quot; This made
the teeny-tiny woman a teeny-tiny more frightened, so she hid her
teeny-tiny head a teeny-tiny further under the teeny-tiny clothes. And
when the teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep again a teeny-tiny time,
the teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard said again a
teeny-tiny louder, &quot;Give me my bone!&quot; And this teeny-tiny woman was a
teeny-tiny bit more frightened, but she put her teeny-tiny head out of
the teeny-tiny clothes, and said in her loudest teeny-tiny voice, &quot;Take
it!&quot;</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id141">THE STORY OF MR. VINEGAR.</a></h2>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
[This story was obtained from oral tradition in the West of
England. It is undoubtedly a variation of the &quot;Hans im Glück&quot;
of Grimm, which is current in Germany.]</blockquote>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Vinegar lived in a vinegar bottle. Now one day, when Mr.
Vinegar was from home, Mrs. Vinegar, who was a very good housewife, was
busily sweeping her house, when an unlucky thump of the broom brought
the whole house clitter-clatter, clitter-clatter, about her ears. In a
paroxysm of grief she rushed forth to meet her husband. On seeing him
she exclaimed, &quot;Oh, Mr. Vinegar, Mr. Vinegar, we are ruined, we are
ruined: I have knocked the house down, and it is all to pieces!&quot; Mr.
Vinegar then said, &quot;My dear, let us see what can be done. Here is the
door; I will take it on my back, and we will go forth to seek our
fortune.&quot; They walked all that day, and at nightfall entered a thick
forest. They were both excessively tired, and Mr. Vinegar said, &quot;My
love, I will climb up into a tree, drag up the door, and you shall
follow.&quot; He accordingly did so, and they both stretched their weary
limbs on the door, and fell fast asleep. In the middle of the night Mr.
Vinegar was disturbed by the sound of voices beneath, and to his
inexpressible dismay perceived that a party of thieves were met to
divide their booty. &quot;Here, Jack,&quot; said one, &quot;here's five pounds for you;
here, Bill, here's ten pounds for you; here, Bob, here's three pounds
for you.&quot; Mr. Vinegar could listen no longer; his terror was so intense
that he trembled most violently, and shook down the door on their
heads. Away scampered the thieves, but Mr. Vinegar dared not quit his
retreat till broad daylight. He then scrambled out of the tree, and went
to lift up the door. What did he behold but a number of golden guineas!
&quot;Come down, Mrs. Vinegar,&quot; he cried, &quot;come down, I say; our fortune's
made, our fortune's made! come down, I say.&quot; Mrs. Vinegar got down as
fast as she could, and saw the money with equal delight. &quot;Now, my dear,&quot;
said she, &quot;I'll tell you what you shall do. There is a fair at the
neighbouring town; you shall take these forty guineas and buy a cow. I
can make butter and cheese, which you shall sell at market, and we shall
then be able to live very comfortably.&quot; Mr. Vinegar joyfully assents,
takes the money, and goes off to the fair. When he arrived, he walked up
and down, and at length saw a beautiful red cow. It was an excellent
milker, and perfect in every respect. Oh! thought Mr. Vinegar, if I had
but that cow I should be the happiest man alive; so he offers the forty
guineas for the cow, and the owner declaring that, as he was a friend,
he'd oblige him, the bargain was made. Proud of his purchase, he drove
the cow backwards and forwards to show it. By-and-by he saw a man
playing the bagpipes, Tweedle dum, tweedle dee; the children followed
him about, and he appeared to be pocketing money on all sides. Well,
thought Mr. Vinegar, if I had but that beautiful instrument I should be
the happiest man alive—my fortune would be made. So he went up to the
man, &quot;Friend,&quot; says he, &quot;what a beautiful instrument that is, and what a
deal of money you must make.&quot; &quot;Why, yes,&quot; said the man, &quot;I make a great
deal of money, to be sure, and it is a wonderful instrument.&quot; &quot;Oh!&quot;
cried Mr. Vinegar, &quot;how I should like to possess it!&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; said the
man, &quot;as you are a friend, I don't much mind parting with it; you shall
have it for that red cow.&quot; &quot;Done,&quot; said the delighted Mr. Vinegar; so
the beautiful red cow was given for the bagpipes. He walked up and down
with his purchase, but in vain he attempted to play a tune, and instead
of pocketing pence, the boys followed him hooting, laughing, and
pelting. Poor Mr. Vinegar, his fingers grew very cold, and, heartily
ashamed and mortified, he was leaving the town, when he met a man with a
fine thick pair of gloves. &quot;Oh, my fingers are so very cold,&quot; said Mr.
Vinegar to himself; &quot;if I had but those beautiful gloves I should be the
happiest man alive.&quot; He went up to the man, and said to him, &quot;Friend,
you seem to have a capital pair of gloves there.&quot; &quot;Yes, truly,&quot; cried
the man; &quot;and my hands are as warm as possible this cold November day.&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; said Mr. Vinegar, &quot;I should like to have them.&quot; &quot;What will you
give?&quot; said the man; &quot;as you are a friend, I don't much mind letting you
have them for those bagpipes.&quot; &quot;Done,&quot; cried Mr. Vinegar. He put on the
gloves, and felt perfectly happy as he trudged homewards. At last he
grew very tired, when he saw a man coming towards him with a good stout
stick in his hand. &quot;Oh,&quot; said Mr. Vinegar, &quot;that I had but that stick! I
should then be the happiest man alive.&quot; He accosted the man—&quot;Friend!
what a rare good stick you have got.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said the man, &quot;I have used
it for many a long mile, and a good friend it has been, but if you have
a fancy for it, as you are a friend, I don't mind giving it to you for
that pair of gloves.&quot; Mr. Vinegar's hands were so warm, and his legs so
tired, that he gladly exchanged. As he drew near to the wood where he
had left his wife, he heard a parrot on a tree calling out his
name—&quot;Mr. Vinegar, you foolish man, you blockhead, you simpleton; you
went to the fair, and laid out all your money in buying a cow; not
content with that, you changed it for bagpipes, on which you could not
play, and which were not worth one tenth of the money. You fool,
you—you had no sooner got the bagpipes than you changed them for the
gloves, which were not worth one quarter of the money; and when you had
got the gloves, you changed them for a poor miserable stick; and now for
your forty guineas, cow, bagpipes, and gloves, you have nothing to show
but that poor miserable stick, which you might have cut in any hedge.&quot;
On this the bird laughed immoderately, and Mr. Vinegar, falling into a
violent rage, threw the stick at its head. The stick lodged in the tree,
and he returned to his wife without money, cow, bagpipes, gloves, or
stick, and she instantly gave him such a sound cudgelling that she
almost broke every bone in his skin.</p>

<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>[&quot;Let us cast away nothing,&quot; says Mr. Gifford, &quot;for we know
not what use we may have for it.&quot; So will every one admit
whose reading has been sufficiently extensive to enable him to

</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was an old miser, who lived with his wife near a
great town, and used to put by every bit of money he could lay his hands
on. His wife was a simple woman, and they lived together without
quarrelling, but she was obliged to put up with very hard fare. Now,
sometimes, when there was a sixpence she thought might be spared for a
comfortable dinner or supper, she used to ask the miser for it, but he
would say, &quot;No, wife, it must be put by for Good Fortune.&quot; It was the
same with every penny he could get hold of, and notwithstanding all she
could say, almost every coin that came into the house was put by &quot;for
Good Fortune.&quot;</p>
<p>The miser said this so often, that some of his neighbours heard him, and
one of them thought of a trick by which he might get the money. So the
first day that the old chuff was away from home, he dressed himself like
a wayfaring man, and knocked at the door. &quot;Who are you?&quot; said the wife.
He answered, &quot;I am Good Fortune, and I am come for the money which your
husband has laid by for me.&quot; So this simple woman, not suspecting any
trickery, readily gave it to him, and, when her good man came home, told
him very pleasantly that Good Fortune had called for the money which had
been kept so long for him.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-three-questions">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id144">THE THREE QUESTIONS.</a></h2>
<p>There lived formerly in the county of Cumberland a nobleman who had
three sons, two of whom were comely and clever youths, but the other a
natural fool, named Jack, who was generally dressed in a party-coloured
coat, and a steeple-crowned hat with a tassel, as became his condition.
Now the King of the East Angles had a beautiful daughter, who was
distinguished by her great ingenuity and wit, and he issued a decree
that whoever should answer three questions put to him by the princess
should have her in marriage, and be heir to the crown at his decease.
Shortly after this decree was published, news of it reached the ears of
the nobleman's sons, and the two clever ones determined to have a trial,
but they were sadly at a loss to prevent their idiot brother from going
with them. They could not, by any means, get rid of him, and were
compelled at length to let Jack accompany them. They had not gone far,
before Jack shrieked with laughter, saying, &quot;I've found an egg.&quot; &quot;Put it
in your pocket,&quot; said the brothers. A little while afterwards, he burst
out into another fit of laughter on finding a crooked hazel stick, which
he also put in his pocket: and a third time, he again laughed
extravagantly because he found a nut. That also was put with his other
treasures.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the palace, they were immediately admitted on
mentioning the nature of their business, and were ushered into a room
where the princess and her suite were sitting. Jack, who never stood on
ceremony, bawled out, &quot;What a troop of fair ladies we've got here!&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; said the princess, &quot;we are fair ladies, for we carry fire in our
bosoms.&quot; &quot;Do you,&quot; said Jack, &quot;then roast me an egg,&quot; pulling out the
egg from his pocket. &quot;How will you get it out again?&quot; said the princess.
&quot;With a crooked stick,&quot; replied Jack, producing the hazel. &quot;Where did
that come from?&quot; said the princess. &quot;From a nut,&quot; answered Jack, pulling
out the nut from his pocket. And thus the &quot;fool of the family,&quot; having
been the first to answer the questions of the princess, was married to
her the next day, and ultimately succeeded to the throne.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id146">THE PRINCESS OF CANTERBURY.</a></h2>
<p>In days of yore, when this country was governed by several sovereigns,
amongst them was the King of Canterbury, who had an only daughter, wise,
fair, and beautiful. She was unmarried, and according to a custom not
unusual in those days, of assigning an arbitrary action for the present
of a lady's hand, the king issued a proclamation that whoever would
watch one night with his daughter, and neither sleep nor doze, should
have her the next day in marriage; but if he did either, he should lose
his head. Many knights attempted to fulfil the condition, and, having
failed in the attempt, forfeited their lives.</p>
<p>Now it happened that a young shepherd, grazing his flock near the road,
said to his master, &quot;Zur, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id35" id="id34">[17]</a> I zee many gentlemen ride to the court at
Canterbury, but I ne'er zee 'em return again.&quot; &quot;O, shepherd,&quot; said his
master, &quot;I know not how you should, for they attempt to watch with the
king's daughter, according to the decree, and not performing it, they
are all beheaded.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; said the shepherd, &quot;I'll try my vorton; zo
now vor a king's daughter, or a headless shepherd!&quot; And taking his
bottle and bag, he trudged to the court. In his way thither, he was
obliged to cross a river, and pulling off his shoes and stockings, while
he was passing over he observed several pretty fish bobbing against his
feet; so he caught some, and put them into his pocket. When he reached
the palace, he knocked at the gate loudly with his crook, and having
mentioned the object of his visit, he was immediately conducted to a
hall, where the king's daughter sat ready prepared to receive her
lovers. He was placed in a luxurious chair, and rich wines and spices
were set before him, and all sorts of delicate meats. The shepherd,
unused to such fare, eat and drank plentifully, so that he was nearly
dozing before midnight. &quot;O shepherd,&quot; said the lady, &quot;I have caught you
napping!&quot; &quot;Noa, sweet ally, I was busy a-feeshing.&quot; &quot;A-fishing!&quot; said
the princess in the utmost astonishment: &quot;Nay, shepherd, there is no
fish-pond in the hall.&quot; &quot;No matter vor that, I have been feeshing in my
pocket, and have just caught one.&quot; &quot;Oh me!&quot; said she, &quot;let me see it.&quot;
The shepherd slily drew the fish out of his pocket, and pretending to
have caught it, showed it her, and she declared it was the finest she
ever saw. About half an hour afterwards, she said, &quot;Shepherd, do you
think you could get me one more?&quot; He replied, &quot;Mayhap I may, when I have
baited my hook;&quot; and after a little while he brought out another, which
was finer than the first, and the princess was so delighted that she
gave him leave to go to sleep, and promised to excuse him to her father.</p>

<p>In the morning the princess told the king, to his great astonishment,
that the shepherd must not be beheaded, for he had been fishing in the
hall all night; but when he heard how the shepherd had caught such
beautiful fish out of his pocket, he asked him to catch one in his own.
The shepherd readily undertook the task, and bidding the king lie down,
he pretended to fish in his pocket, having another fish concealed ready
in his hand, and giving him a sly prick with a needle, he held up the
fish, and showed it to the king. His majesty did not much relish the
operation, but he assented to the marvel of it, and the princess and
shepherd were united the same day, and lived for many years in happiness
and prosperity.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id147">LAZY JACK.</a></h2>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
[From oral tradition in Yorkshire.]</blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was a boy whose name was Jack, and he lived with
his mother on a dreary common. They were very poor, and the old woman
got her living by spinning, but Jack was so lazy that he would do
nothing but bask in the sun in the hot weather, and sit by the corner of
the hearth in the winter time. His mother could not persuade him to do
anything for her, and was obliged at last to tell him that if he did not
begin to work for his porridge, she would turn him out to get his living
as he could.</p>
<p>This threat at length roused Jack, and he went out and hired himself for
the day to a neighbouring farmer for a penny; but as he was coming home,
never having had any money in his possession before, he lost it in
passing over a brook. &quot;You stupid boy,&quot; said his mother, &quot;you should
have put it in your pocket.&quot; &quot;I'll do so another time,&quot; replied Jack.</p>
<p>The next day Jack went out again, and hired himself to a cowkeeper, who
gave him a jar of milk for his day's work. Jack took the jar and put it
into the large pocket of his jacket, spilling it all, long before he got
home. &quot;Dear me!&quot; said the old woman; &quot;you should have carried it on your
head.&quot; &quot;I'll do so another time,&quot; replied Jack.</p>
<p>The following day Jack hired himself again to a farmer, who agreed to
give him a cream cheese for his services. In the evening, Jack took the
cheese, and went home with it on his head. By the time he got home the
cheese was completely spoilt, part of it being lost, and part matted
with his hair. &quot;You stupid lout,&quot; said his mother, &quot;you should have
carried it very carefully in your hands.&quot; &quot;I'll do so another time,&quot;
replied Jack.</p>
<p>The day after this Jack again went out, and hired himself to a baker,
who would give him nothing for his work but a large tom-cat. Jack took
the cat, and began carrying it very carefully in his hands, but in a
short time Pussy scratched him so much that he was compelled to let it
go. When he got home, his mother said to him, &quot;You silly fellow, you
should have tied it with a string, and dragged it along after you.&quot;
&quot;I'll do so another time,&quot; said Jack.</p>
<p>The next day Jack hired himself to a butcher, who rewarded his labours
by the handsome present of a shoulder of mutton. Jack took the mutton,
tied it to a string, and trailed it along after him in the dirt, so that
by the time he had got home the meat was completely spoilt. His mother
was this time quite out of patience with him, for the next day was
Sunday, and she was obliged to content herself with cabbage for her
dinner. &quot;You ninnyhammer,&quot; said she to her son, &quot;you should have carried
it on your shoulder.&quot; &quot;I'll do so another time,&quot; replied Jack.</p>
<p>On the Monday Jack went once more, and hired himself to a cattle-keeper,
who gave him a donkey for his trouble. Although Jack was very strong, he
found some difficulty in hoisting the donkey on his shoulders, but at
last he accomplished it, and began walking slowly home with his prize.
Now it happened that in the course of his journey there lived a rich man
with his only daughter, a beautiful girl, but unfortunately deaf and
dumb; she had never laughed in her life, and the doctors said she would
never recover till somebody made her laugh. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id37" id="id36">[18]</a> Many tried without
success, and at last the father, in despair, offered her in marriage to
the first man who could make her laugh. This young lady happened to be
looking out of the window when Jack was passing with the donkey on his
shoulders, the legs sticking up in the air, and the sight was so comical
and strange, that she burst out into a great fit of laughter, and
immediately recovered her speech and hearing. Her father was overjoyed,
and fulfilled his promise by marrying her to Jack, who was thus made a
rich gentleman. They lived in a large house, and Jack's mother lived
with them in great happiness until she died.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id148">THE THREE HEADS OF THE WELL.</a></h2>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
[This story is abridged from the old chap-book of the Three
Kings of Colchester. The incident of the heads rising out of
the well is very similar to one introduced in Peele's Old
Wives Tale, 1595, and the verse is also of a similar
character.]</blockquote>
<p>Long before Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, there reigned in
the eastern part of England a king who kept his court at Colchester. He
was witty, strong, and valiant, by which means he subdued his enemies
abroad, and secured peace among his subjects at home. Nevertheless, in
the midst of his glory, his queen died, leaving behind her an only
daughter, about fifteen years of age. This lady, from her courtly
carriage, beauty, and affability, was the wonder of all that knew her;
but, as covetousness is said to be the root of all evil, so it happened
in this instance. The king hearing of a lady who had likewise an only
daughter, for the sake of her riches had a mind to marry; though she was
old, ugly, hook-nosed, and humpbacked, yet all this could not deter him
from marrying her. Her daughter, also, was a yellow dowdy, full of envy
and ill-nature; and, in short, was much of the same mould as her mother.
This signified nothing, for in a few weeks the king, attended by the
nobility and gentry, brought his intended bride to his palace, where the
marriage rites were performed. They had not been long in the court
before they set the king against his own beautiful daughter, which was
done by false reports and accusations. The young princess, having lost
her father's love, grew weary of the court, and one day meeting with
her father in the garden, she desired him, with tears in her eyes, to
give her a small subsistence, and she would go and seek her fortune; to
which the king consented, and ordered her mother-in-law to make up a
small sum according to her discretion. She went to the queen, who gave
her a canvass bag of brown bread and hard cheese, with a bottle of beer;
though this was but a very pitiful dowry for a king's daughter. She took
it, returned thanks, and proceeded on her journey, passing through
groves, woods, and valleys, till at length she saw an old man sitting on
a stone at the mouth of a cave, who said, &quot;Good morrow, fair maiden,
whither away so fast?&quot; &quot;Aged father,&quot; says she, &quot;I am going to seek my
fortune.&quot; &quot;What has thou in thy bag and bottle?&quot; &quot;In my bag I have got
bread and cheese, and in my bottle good small beer; will you please to
partake of either?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;with all my heart.&quot; With that the
lady pulled out her provisions, and bid him eat and welcome. He did so,
and gave her many thanks, saying thus: &quot;There is a thick thorny hedge
before you, which will appear impassable, but take this wand in your
hand, strike three times, and say, 'Pray, hedge, let me come through,'
and it will open immediately; then, a little further, you will, find a
well; sit down on the brink of it, and there will come up three golden
heads, which will speak: pray do whatever they require.&quot; Promising she
would follow his directions, she took her leave of him. Arriving at the
hedge, and pursuing the old man's directions, it divided, and gave her a
passage; then, going to the well, she had no sooner sat down than a
golden head came up singing—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Wash me, and comb me,</div>
<div class="line">And lay me down softly,</div>
<div class="line">And lay me on a bank to dry,</div>
<div class="line">That I may look pretty,</div>
<div class="line">When somebody comes by.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said she, and putting forth her hand, with a silver comb
performed the office, placing it upon a primrose bank. Then came up a
second and a third head, making the same request, which she complied
with. She then pulled out her provisions and ate her dinner. Then said
the heads one to another, &quot;What shall we do for this lady who hath used
us so kindly?&quot; The first said, &quot;I will cause such addition to her beauty
as shall charm the most powerful prince in the world.&quot; The second said,
&quot;I will endow her with such perfume, both in body and breath, as shall
far exceed the sweetest flowers.&quot; The third said, &quot;My gift shall be none
of the least, for, as she is a king's daughter, I'll make her so
fortunate that she shall become queen to the greatest prince that
reigns.&quot; This done, at their request she let them down into the well
again, and so proceeded on her journey. She had not travelled long
before she saw a king hunting in the park with his nobles; she would
have avoided him, but the king having caught a sight of her, approached,
and what with her beauty and perfumed breath, was so powerfully smitten,
that he was not able to subdue his passion, but commenced his courtship
immediately, and was so successful that he gained her love, and,
conducting her to his palace, he caused her to be clothed in the most
magnificent manner.</p>
<p>This being ended, and the king finding that she was the king of
Colchester's daughter, ordered some chariots to be got ready, that he
might pay the king a visit. The chariot in which the king and queen rode
was adorned with rich ornamental gems of gold. The king, her father, was
at first astonished that his daughter had been so fortunate as she was,
till the young king made him sensible of all that happened. Great was
the joy at court amongst all, with the exception of the queen and her
club-footed daughter, who were ready to burst with malice, and envied
her happiness; and the greater was their madness because she was now
above them all. Great rejoicings, with feasting and dancing, continued
many days. Then at length, with the dowry her father gave her they
returned home.</p>
<p>The deformed daughter perceiving that her sister had been so happy in
seeking her fortune, would needs do the same; so disclosing her mind to
her mother, all preparations were made, and she was furnished not only
with rich apparel, but sweetmeats, sugar, almonds, &amp;c., in great
quantities, and a large bottle of Malaga sack. Thus provided, she went
the same road as her sister, and coming near the cave, the old man said,
&quot;Young woman, whither so fast?&quot; &quot;What is that to you,&quot; said she. &quot;Then,&quot;
said he, &quot;what have you in your bag and bottle?&quot; She answered, &quot;Good
things, which you shall not be troubled with.&quot; &quot;Won't you give me some?&quot;
said he. &quot;No, not a bit, nor a drop, unless it would choke you.&quot; The old
man frowned, saying, &quot;Evil fortune attend thee.&quot; Going on, she came to
the hedge, through which she espied a gap, and thought to pass through
it, but, going in, the hedge closed, and the thorns run into her flesh,
so that it was with great difficulty that she got out. Being now in a
painful condition, she searched for water to wash herself, and, looking
round, she saw the well; she sat down on the brink of it, and one of the
heads came up, saying, &quot;Wash me, comb me, and lay me down softly, &amp;c.&quot;
but she banged it with her bottle, saying, &quot;Take this for your washing.&quot;
So the second and third heads came up, and met with no better treatment
than the first; whereupon the heads consulted among themselves what
evils to plague her with for such usage. The first said, &quot;Let her be
struck with leprosy in her face.&quot; The second, &quot;Let an additional smell
be added to her breath.&quot; The third bestowed on her a husband, though but
a poor country cobler. This done, she goes on till she came to a town,
and it being market day, the people looked at her, and seeing such an
evil face fled out of her sight, all but a poor cobler (who not long
before had mended the shoes of an old hermit, who having no money, gave
him a box of ointment for the cure of the leprosy, and a bottle of
spirits for a stinking breath). Now the cobler having a mind to do an
act of charity, was induced to go up to her and ask her who she was. &quot;I
am,&quot; said she, &quot;the king of Colchester's daughter-in-law.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; said
the cobler, &quot;if I restore you to your natural complexion, and make a
sound cure both in face and breath, will you in reward take me for a
husband?&quot; &quot;Yes, friend,&quot; replied she, &quot;with all my heart.&quot; With this the
cobler applied the remedies, and they worked the effect in a few weeks,
and then they were married, and after a few days they set forward for
the court at Colchester. When the queen understood she had married a
poor cobler, she fell into distraction, and hanged herself for vexation.
The death of the queen was not a source of sorrow to the king, who had
only married her for her fortune, and bore her no affection; and shortly
afterwards he gave the cobler a hundred pounds to take the daughter to a
remote part of the kingdom, where he lived many years mending shoes,
while his wife assisted the housekeeping by spinning, and selling the
results of her labours at the country market.</p>

[This tale of the frog-lover is known in every part of
Germany, and is alluded to by several old writers of that
country. It is the tale &quot;Der Froschkönig, oder der Eiserne
Heinrich,&quot; in Grimm. &quot;These enchanted frogs,&quot; says Sir W.
Scott, &quot;have migrated from afar, and we suspect that they were
originally crocodiles; we trace them in a tale forming part of
a series of stories entitled the Relations of Ssidi Kur,
extant amongst the Calmuck Tartars.&quot; Mr. Chambers has given a
Scotch version of the tale, under the title of &quot;The well o'
the warld's end,&quot; in his Popular Rhymes, p. 236. The rhymes in
the copy given above were obtained from the North of England,
without, however, any reference to the story to which they
evidently belong. The application, however, is so obvious to
any one acquainted with the German and Scotch tale, that the
framework I have ventured to give them cannot be considered
incongruous; although I need not add how very desirable it
would be to procure the traditional tale as related by the
English peasantry. Perhaps some of our readers may be enabled
to supply it.]</blockquote>
<p>Many years ago there lived on the brow of a mountain, in the North of
England, an old woman and her daughter. They were very poor, and
obliged to work very hard for their living, and the old woman's temper
was not very good, so that the maiden, who was very beautiful, led but
an ill life with her. The girl, indeed, was compelled to do the hardest
work, for her mother got their principal means of subsistence by
travelling to places in the neighbourhood with small articles for sale,
and when she came home in the afternoon she was not able to do much more
work. Nearly the whole domestic labour of the cottage devolved therefore
on the daughter, the most wearisome part of which consisted in the
necessity of fetching all the water they required from a well on the
other side of the hill, there being no river or spring near their own
cottage.</p>
<p>It happened one morning that the daughter had the misfortune, in going
to the well, to break the only pitcher they possessed, and having no
other utensil she could use for the purpose, she was obliged to go home
without bringing any water. When her mother returned, she was
unfortunately troubled with excessive thirst, and the girl, though
trembling for the consequences of her misfortune, told her exactly the
circumstance that had occurred. The old woman was furiously angry, and
so far from making any allowances for her daughter, pointed to a sieve
which happened to be on the table, and told her to go at once to the
well and bring her some water in that, or never venture to appear again
in her sight.</p>
<p>The young maiden, frightened almost out of her wits by her mother's
fury, speedily took the sieve, and though she considered the task a
hopeless one to accomplish, almost unconsciously hastened to the well.
When she arrived there, beginning to reflect on the painful situation in
which she was placed, and the utter impossibility of her obtaining a
living by herself, she threw herself down on the brink of the well in an
agony of despair. Whilst she was in this condition, a large frog came up
to the top of the water, and asked her for what she was crying so
bitterly. She was somewhat surprised at this, but not being the least
frightened, told him the whole story, and that she was crying because
she could not carry away water in the sieve. &quot;Is that all?&quot; said the
frog; &quot;cheer up, my hinny! for if you will only let me sleep with you
for two nights, and then chop off my head, I will tell you how to do
it.&quot; The maiden thought the frog could not be in earnest, but she was
too impatient to consider much about it, and at once made the required
promise. The frog then instructed her in the following words,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Stop with fog (<em>moss</em>),</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And daub with clay;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And that will carry</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The water away.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Having said this, he dived immediately under the water, and the girl,
having followed his advice, got the sieve full of water, and returned
home with it, not thinking much of her promise to the frog. By the time
she reached home the old woman's wrath was appeased, but as they were
eating their frugal supper very quietly, what should they hear but the
splashing and croaking of a frog near the door, and shortly afterwards
the daughter recognised the voice of the frog of the well saying,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Open the door, my hinny, my heart,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Open the door, my own darling;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Remember the words you spoke to me,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In the meadow by the well-spring.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>She was now dreadfully frightened, and hurriedly explained the matter to
her mother, who was also so much alarmed at the circumstance, that she
dared not refuse admittance to the frog, who, when the door was opened,
leapt into the room, exclaiming:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Go wi' me to bed, my hinny, my heart,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Go wi' me to bed, my own darling;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Remember the words you spoke to me,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In the meadow by the well-spring.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This command was also obeyed, although, as may be readily supposed, she
did not much relish such a bedfellow. The next day, the frog was very
quiet, and evidently enjoyed the fare they placed before him,—the
purest milk and the finest bread they could procure. In fact, neither
the old woman nor her daughter spared any pains to render the frog
comfortable. That night, immediately supper was finished, the frog again
exclaimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Go wi' me to bed, my hinny, my heart,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Go wi' me to bed, my own darling;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Remember the words you spoke to me,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In the meadow by the well-spring.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>She again allowed the frog to share her couch, and in the morning, as
soon as she was dressed, he jumped towards her, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Chop off my head, my hinny, my heart,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Chop off my head, my own darling;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Remember the words you spoke to me,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In the meadow by the well-spring.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The maiden had no sooner accomplished this last request, than in the
stead of the frog there stood by her side the handsomest prince in the
world, who had long been transformed by a magician, and who could never
have recovered his natural shape until a beautiful virgin had consented,
of her own accord, to make him her bedfellow for two nights. The joy of
all parties was complete; the girl and the prince were shortly
afterwards married, and lived for many years in the enjoyment of every
happiness.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id150">THE STORY OF MR. FOX.</a></h2>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
[A simple, but very curious tale, of considerable antiquity.
It is alluded to by Shakespeare, and was contributed to the
variorum edition by Blakeway. Part of this story will recall
to the reader's memory the enchanted chamber of Britomart.]</blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time there was a young lady called Lady Mary, who had two
brothers. One summer they all three went to a country seat of theirs
which they had not before visited. Among the other gentry in the
neighbourhood who came to see them was a Mr. Fox, a bachelor, with whom
they, particularly the young lady, were much pleased. He used often to
dine with them, and frequently invited Lady Mary to come and see his
house. One day, when her brothers were absent elsewhere, and she had
nothing better to do, she determined to go thither, and accordingly set
out unattended. When she arrived at the house and knocked at the door,
no one answered. At length she opened it and went in, and over the
portal of the door was written:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Be bold, be bold, but not too bold.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>She advanced, and found the same inscription over the staircase; again
at the entrance of a gallery; and lastly, at the door of a chamber, with
the addition of a line:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Be bold, be bold, but not too bold,</div>
<div class="line">Lest that your heart's blood should run cold!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>She opened it, and what was her terror and astonishment to find the
floor covered with bones and blood. She retreated in haste, and coming
down stairs, she saw from a window Mr. Fox advancing towards the house
with a drawn sword in one hand, while with the other he dragged along a
young lady by the hair of her head. Lady Mary had just time to slip
down, and hide herself under the stairs, before Mr. Fox and his victim
arrived at the foot of them. As he pulled the young lady upstairs, she
caught hold of one of the bannisters with her hand, on which was a rich
bracelet. Mr. Fox cut it off with his sword: the hand and bracelet fell
into Lady Mary's lap, who then contrived to escape unobserved, and got
safe home to her brothers' house.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards, Mr. Fox came to dine with them as usual. After
dinner, the guests began to amuse each other with extraordinary
anecdotes, and Lady Mary said she would relate to them a remarkable
dream she had lately had. I dreamt, said she, that as you, Mr. Fox, had
often invited me to your house, I would go there one morning. When I
came to the house, I knocked at the door, but no one answered. When I
opened the door, over the hall I saw written, &quot;Be bold, be bold, but not
too bold.&quot; But, said she, turning to Mr. Fox, and smiling, &quot;It is not
so, nor it was not so.&quot; Then she pursued the rest of the story,
concluding at every turn with, &quot;It is not so, nor it was not so,&quot; till
she came to the discovery of the room full of bones, when Mr. Fox took
up the burden of the tale, and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">It is not so, nor it was not so,</div>
<div class="line">And God forbid it should be so!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>which he continued to repeat at every subsequent turn of the dreadful
story, till she came to the circumstance of his cutting off the young
lady's hand, when, upon his saying, as usual,</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">It is not so, nor it was not so,</div>
<div class="line">And God forbid it should be so!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Mary retorts by saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But it is so, and it was so,</div>
<div class="line">And here the hand I have to show!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>at the same moment producing the hand and bracelet from her lap.
Whereupon the guests drew their swords, and instantly cut Mr. Fox into a
thousand pieces.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-oxford-student">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id151">THE OXFORD STUDENT.</a></h2>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
[Obtained in Oxfordshire from tradition.]</blockquote>
<p>Many years ago there lived at the University of Oxford a young student,
who, having seduced the daughter of a tradesman, sought to conceal his
crime by committing the more heinous one of murder. With this view, he
made an appointment to meet her one evening in a secluded field. She was
at the rendezvous considerably before the time agreed upon for their
meeting, and hid herself in a tree. The student arrived on the spot
shortly afterwards, but what was the astonishment of the girl to observe
that he commenced digging a grave. Her fears and suspicions were
aroused, and she did not leave her place of concealment till the
student, despairing of her arrival, returned to his college. The next
day, when she was at the door of her father's house, he passed and
saluted her as usual. She returned his greeting by repeating the
following lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">One moonshiny night, as I sat high,</div>
<div class="line">Waiting for one to come by,</div>
<div class="line">The boughs did bend; my heart did ache</div>
<div class="line">To see what hole the fox did make.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Astounded by her unexpected knowledge of his base design, in a moment of
fury he stabbed her to the heart. This murder occasioned a violent
conflict between the tradespeople and the students, the latter taking
part with the murderer, and so fierce was the skirmish, that Brewer's
Lane, it is said, ran down with blood. The place of appointment was
adjoining the Divinity Walk, which was in time past far more secluded

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id152">JACK HORNBY.</a></h2>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
[This little tale was most likely copied from the commencement
of the original edition of Jack the Giant-killer, where
similar incidents are related of that renowned hero.]</blockquote>
<p>In the reign of King Arthur there lived near the Land's End, in
Cornwall, a wealthy farmer, who had an only son, commonly called Jack
Hornby. He was of a brisk and ready wit, and he was never known to be
outwitted in any transaction.</p>
<p>One day, when he was no more than seven years of age, his father sent
him into the field to look after his oxen. While he was attending to
them, the lord of the manor came across the field, and as Jack was known
to be a clever boy, he began asking him questions. His first was, &quot;How
many commandments are there?&quot; Jack told him there were nine. The lord
corrected him, saying there were ten. &quot;Nay,&quot; quoth Jack, &quot;you are wrong
there: it is true there were ten, but you broke one of them when you
stole my father's cow for your rent.&quot; The lord of the manor was so
struck by this answer, that he promised to return the poor man's cow.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; quoth Jack, &quot;it is my turn to ask a question. Can you tell me how
many sticks go to build a crow's nest?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;there are as
many go as are sufficient for the size of the nest.&quot; &quot;Oh!&quot; quoth Jack,
&quot;you are out again; there are none go, for they are all carried!&quot;</p>
<p>Jack Hornby was never more troubled with questions by the lord of the
manor.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id153">MALLY DIXON AND KNURRE-MURRE.</a></h2>
<p>Stories of fairies appearing in the shape of cats are common in the
North of England. Mr. Longstaffe relates that a farmer of Staindrop, in
Durham, was one night crossing a bridge, when a cat jumped out, stood
before him, and looking him full in the face, said:</p>
<blockquote>
Johnny Reed! Johnny Reed!
Tell Madam Momfort
That Mally Dixon's dead.</blockquote>
<p>The farmer returned home, and in mickle wonder recited this awfu' stanza
to his wife, when up started their black cat, saying, &quot;Is she?&quot; and
disappeared for ever. It was supposed she was a fairy in disguise, who
thus went to attend a sister's funeral, for in the North fairies do die,
and green shady spots are pointed out by the country folks as the
cemeteries of the tiny people. An analogous story is found in the
people-literature of Denmark. Near a town called Lyng is the hill of
Brondhoë, inhabited by the trold-folk, or imps. Amongst these trolds was
an old sickly devil, peevish and ill-tempered, because he was married to
a young wife. This unhappy trold often set the rest by the ears, so they
nicknamed him Knurre-Murre, or Rumble-Grumble. Now it came to pass, that
Knurre-Murre discovered that his young wife was inclined to honour him
with a supplemental pair of horns; and the object of his jealousy, to
avoid his vengeance, was compelled to fly for his life from the cavern,
and take refuge, in the shape of a tortoise-shell cat, in the house of
Goodman Platt, who harboured him with much hospitality, let him lie on
the great wicker chair, and fed him twice a day with bread and milk out
of a red earthenware pipkin. One evening the goodman came home, at a
late hour, full of wonderment. &quot;Goody,&quot; exclaimed he to his wife, &quot;as I
was passing by Brondhoë, there came out a trold, who spake to me,
saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Hör du Plat,</div>
<div class="line">Süg til din cat</div>
<div class="line">At Knurre-Murre er död.</div>

<div class="line">Hear thou, Platt,</div>
<div class="line">Say to thy cat</div>
<div class="line">That Knurre-Murre is dead.&quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The tortoise-shell cat was lying on the great wicker chair, and eating
his supper of bread and milk out of the red earthenware pipkin, when the
goodman came in; but as soon as the message was delivered, he jumped
bolt upright upon his two hind legs, for all the world like a Christian,
and kicking the red earthenware pipkin and the rest of the bread and
milk before him, he whisked through the cottage door, mewing, &quot;What! is
Knurre-Murre dead? then I may go home again!&quot; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id39" id="id38">[19]</a></p>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a king who had three daughters; the two
eldest were proud and ugly, but the youngest was the gentlest and most
beautiful creature ever seen, and the pride not only of her father and
mother, but of all in the land. As it fell out, the three princesses
were talking one night of whom they would marry. &quot;I will have no one
lower than a king,&quot; said the eldest princess; the second would take a
prince, or a great duke even. &quot;Pho, pho,&quot; said the youngest, laughing,
&quot;you are both so proud; now, I would be content with the Red Bull o'
Norroway.&quot; Well, they thought no more of the matter till the next
morning, when, as they sat at breakfast, they heard the most dreadful
bellowing at the door, and what should it be but the Red Bull come for
his bride. You may be sure they were all terribly frightened at this,
for the Red Bull was one of the most horrible creatures ever seen in the
world. And the king and queen did not know how to save their daughter.
At last they determined to send him off with the old henwife. So they
put her on his back, and away he went with her till he came to a great
black forest, when, throwing her down, he returned, roaring louder and
more frightfully than ever. They then sent, one by one, all the
servants, then the two eldest princesses; but not one of them met with
any better treatment than the old henwife, and at last they were forced
to send their youngest and favorite child.</p>
<p>On travelled the lady and the bull through many dreadful forests and
lonely wastes, till they came at last to a noble castle, where a large
company was assembled. The lord of the castle pressed them to stay,
though much he wondered at the lovely princess and her strange
companion. When they went in among the company, the princess espied a
pin sticking in the bull's hide, which she pulled out, and, to the
surprise of all, there appeared not a frightful wild beast, but one of
the most beautiful princes ever beheld. You may believe how delighted
the princess was to see him fall at her feet, and thank her for breaking
his cruel enchantment. There were great rejoicings in the castle at
this; but, alas! at that moment he suddenly disappeared, and though
every place was sought, he was nowhere to be found. The princess,
however, determined to seek through all the world for him, and many
weary ways she went, but nothing could she hear of her lover. Travelling
once through a dark wood, she lost her way, and as night was coming on,
she thought she must now certainly die of cold and hunger; but seeing a
light through the trees, she went on till she came to a little hut,
where an old woman lived, who took her in, and gave her both food and
shelter. In the morning, the old wifie gave her three nuts, that she was
not to break till her heart was &quot;like to break, and owre again like to
break;&quot; so, showing her the way, she bade God speed her, and the
princess once more set out on her wearisome journey.</p>
<p>She had not gone far till a company of lords and ladies rode past her,
all talking merrily of the fine doings they expected at the Duke o'
Norroway's wedding. Then she came up to a number of people carrying all
sorts of fine things, and they, too, were going to the duke's wedding.
At last she came to a castle, where nothing was to be seen but cooks and
bakers, some running one way, and some another, and all so busy that
they did not know what to do first. Whilst she was looking at all this,
she heard a noise of hunters behind her, and some one cried out, &quot;Make
way for the Duke o' Norroway!&quot; and who should ride past but the prince
and a beautiful lady! You may be sure her heart was now &quot;like to break,
and owre again like to break,&quot; at this sad sight; so she broke one of
the nuts, and out came a wee wifie carding. The princess then went into
the castle, and asked to see the lady, who no sooner saw the wee wifie
so hard at work, than she offered the princess anything in her castle
for it. &quot;I will give it to you,&quot; said she, &quot;only on condition that you
put off for one day your marriage with the Duke o' Norroway, and that I
may go into his room alone to-night.&quot; So anxious was the lady for the
nut, that she consented. And when dark night was come, and the duke fast
asleep, the princess was put alone into his chamber. Sitting down by
his bedside, she began singing:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Far hae I sought ye, near am I brought to ye;</div>
<div class="line">Dear Duke of Norroway, will ye no turn and speak to me?</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Though she sang this over and over again, the duke never wakened, and in
the morning the princess had to leave him, without his knowing she had
ever been there. She then broke the second nut, and out came a wee wifie
spinning, which so delighted the lady, that she readily agreed to put
off her marriage another day for it; but the princess came no better
speed the second night than the first, and, almost in despair, she broke
the last nut, which contained a wee wifie reeling; and on the same
condition as before, the lady got possession of it. When the duke was
dressing in the morning, his man asked him what the strange singing and
moaning that had been heard in his room for two nights meant. &quot;I heard
nothing,&quot; said the duke; &quot;it could only have been your fancy.&quot; &quot;Take no
sleeping-draught to night, and be sure to lay aside your pillow of
heaviness,&quot; said the man, &quot;and you also will hear what for two nights
has kept me awake.&quot; The duke did so, and the princess coming in, sat
down sighing at his bedside, thinking this the last time she might ever
see him. The duke started up when he heard the voice of his dearly-loved
princess; and with many endearing expressions of surprise and joy,
explained to her that he had long been in the power of an enchantress,
whose spells over him were now happily ended by their once again
meeting. The princess, happy to be the instrument of his second
deliverance, consented to marry him, and the enchantress, who fled that
country, afraid of the duke's anger, has never since been heard of. All
was hurry and preparation in the castle, and the marriage which now took
place at once ended the adventures of the Red Bull o' Norroway and the
wanderings of the king's daughter.</p>

[One of the tales of Perrault, 1697. The plot was taken from

is that talents are equivalent to fortune. We have inserted

<p>There was a miller, who left no more estate to his three sons than his
mill, his ass, and his cat. The partition was soon made, neither
scrivener nor attorney being sent for. They would soon have eaten up all
the patrimony. The eldest had the mill, the second the ass, and the
youngest nothing but the cat.</p>
<p>The poor young fellow was quite downcast at so poor a lot. &quot;My
brothers,&quot; said he, &quot;may get their living handsomely enough by joining
their stocks together, but for my part, when I have eaten up my cat, and
made me a muff of his skin, I must die with hunger.&quot; The cat, who heard
all this, yet made as if he did not, said to him, with a grave and
serious air, &quot;Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master; you have
nothing else to do but give me a bag, and get a pair of boots made for
me, that I may scamper through the dirt and the brambles, and you shall
see that you have not so bad a portion as you imagine.&quot; Though he did
not build very much upon what the cat said, he had however often seen
him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice: as when he
used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and make as if
he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him
some help in his miserable condition. When the cat had what he asked
for, he booted himself very gallantly; and putting the bag about his
neck, held the strings of it in his two fore paws, and went into a
warren where there was a great abundance of rabbits. He put bran and
sow-thistles into the bag, and stretching himself out at length, as if
he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbits not yet acquainted
with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he
had put into it.</p>
<p>Scarce was he laid down, but he had what he wanted; a rash and foolish
young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss immediately drawing
the strings close, took and killed him without pity. Proud of his prey,
he went with it into the palace, and asked to speak with his majesty. He
was shown upstairs into the king's apartment, and, making a low
reverence, said to him, &quot;I have brought you, Sire, a rabbit of the
warren, which my noble lord, the Marquis of Carabas (for that was the
title which Puss was pleased to give his master), has commanded me to
present to your majesty from him.&quot; &quot;Tell thy master,&quot; said the king,
&quot;that I thank him, and he does me a great deal of pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p>Another time he went and hid himself amongst some standing corn, holding
his bag open; and when a brace of partridges ran into it, he drew the
strings, and so caught them both. He went and made a present of these to
the king, as he had done before of the rabbit. The king received the
partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money for drink.</p>
<p>The cat continued, for two or three months, to carry game to his
majesty. One day in particular, when he knew that the king was to take
the air along the river side, with his daughter, the most beautiful
princess in the world, he said to his master, &quot;If you will follow my
advice, your fortune is made; you have nothing else to do, but go and
wash yourself in the river, in that part I shall show you, and leave the
rest to me.&quot; The Marquis of Carabas did what the cat advised, without
knowing why or wherefore.</p>
<p>While he was washing, the king passed by, and the cat began to cry out,
as loud as he could, &quot;Help, help! my Lord Marquis of Carabas is going to
be drowned!&quot; At this noise the king put his head out of the
coach-window, and finding it was the cat who had so often brought him
such good game, he commanded the guards to run immediately to the
assistance of his lordship, the Marquis of Carabas.</p>
<p>While they were drawing the poor marquis out of the river, the cat came
up to the coach and told the king, that, while his master was washing,
there came by some rogues who went off with his clothes, though he had
cried out, &quot;Thieves! thieves!&quot; several times, as loud as he could. This
cunning cat had hidden them under a great stone. The king immediately
commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best
suits for the Lord Marquis of Carabas.</p>
<p>The king caressed him after a very extraordinary manner, and as the fine
clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien (for he was
well-made and very handsome in his person), the king's daughter took a
secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast
two or three respectful and tender glances, but she fell in love with
him to distraction; and the king would have him come into his coach. The
cat, overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed, marched on before,
and meeting with some countrymen who were mowing a meadow, he said to
them, &quot;Good people, if you do not tell the king that the meadow you mow
belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as
herbs for the pot.&quot;</p>
<p>The king did not fail to ask the mowers to whom the meadow they were
mowing belonged. &quot;To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,&quot; answered they all
together; for the cat's threats had made them terribly afraid. &quot;You see,
sir,&quot; said the marquis, &quot;this is a meadow that never fails to yield a
plentiful harvest every year.&quot; The cat, who still went on before, met
with some reapers, and said to them, &quot;Good people, you who are reaping,
if you do not tell the king that all this corn belongs to the Marquis
of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot.&quot; The
king, who passed by a moment after, would needs know to whom all that
corn did belong. &quot;To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,&quot; replied the reapers;
and the king was very well pleased with it, as well as the marquis, whom
he congratulated thereupon. The master cat went always before, saying
the same words to all he met; and the king was astonished at the vast
estates of my Lord Marquis of Carabas. Monsieur Puss came at last to a
stately castle, the master of which was an ogre, the richest that had
ever been known; for all the lands the king had then gone over belonged
to him; the cat, having taken care to inform himself who this ogre was,
and what he could do, asked to speak to him, saying, &quot;He could not pass
so near his castle, without having the honour of paying his respects to
him.&quot;</p>
<p>The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre could do, and made him sit
down. &quot;I have been assured,&quot; said the cat, &quot;that you have the gift of
being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a
mind to; you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion or
elephant, and the like.&quot; &quot;This is true,&quot; answered the ogre, very briskly,
&quot;and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion.&quot; Puss was so
sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him, that he immediately
got into the gutter, not without great trouble and danger, because of
his boots, which were of no use at all to him in walking upon the tiles.
A little while after, when Puss saw that the ogre had resumed his
natural form, he came down, and owned that he had been very much
frightened.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been moreover informed,&quot; said the cat, &quot;but I know not how to
believe it, that you have also the power to take upon you the smallest
animals, for example, to change yourself into a rat or a mouse, but I
must own to you, I take this to be impossible.&quot; &quot;Impossible!&quot; cried the
ogre, &quot;you shall see that presently;&quot; and at the same time changed
himself into a mouse, and began to run about the floor. Puss no sooner
perceived this, but he fell upon him, and eat him up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the king, who saw as he passed this fine castle of the ogre's,
had a mind to go into it. Puss, who heard the noise of his majesty's
coach running over the drawbridge, ran out, and said to the king, &quot;Your
majesty is welcome to this castle of the Lord Marquis of Carabas.&quot;
&quot;What! my lord marquis,&quot; cried the king, &quot;and does this castle also
belong to you? there can be nothing finer than this court, and all the
stately buildings which surround it: let us go into it, if you please.&quot;</p>
<p>The king went up first, the marquis, handing the princess, following;
they passed into a spacious hall, where they found a magnificent
collation the ogre had prepared for his friends, who dared not enter,
knowing the king was there. His majesty was perfectly charmed with the
good qualities of the marquis, and his daughter was violently in love
with him. The king, after having drank five or six glasses, said to him,
&quot;My lord marquis, you will be only to blame, if you are not my
son-in-law.&quot; The marquis, making several low bows, accepted the honour
his majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith the very same day married
the princess.</p>
<p>Puss became a great lord, and never ran after mice any more but only for
his diversion.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id156">JACK AND THE GIANTS.</a></h2>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>[The present copy of this tale is taken, with a few necessary
alterations, from the original editions, which differ very
considerably from the modern versions; and it is worthy of
preservation in its antique costume, for the story is
undoubtedly of Teutonic origin. &quot;Jack, commonly called the
Giant Killer,&quot; says Sir W. Scott, &quot;and Thomas Thumb landed in
England from the very same keels and war-ships which conveyed
Hengist and Horsa, and Ebba the Saxon.&quot; One incident in the
romance exactly corresponds to a device played by the giant
Skrimner, when he and Thor travelled to Utgard Castle, related
in the Edda of Snorro. Skrimner placed an immense rock on the
leafy couch where Thor supposed he was sleeping, and when the
latter, desiring to rid himself of his companion, heard the
giant snore, he struck the rock with his tremendous hammer,
thinking it was the monster's head. &quot;Hath a leaf fallen upon
me from the tree?&quot; exclaimed the awakened giant. He went to
sleep again, and snoring louder than ever, Thor gave a blow
which he thought must have cracked his skull. &quot;What is the
matter?&quot; quoth Skrimner, &quot;hath an acorn fallen on my head?&quot; A
third time the snore was heard, and a third time the hammer
fell with redoubled force, insomuch that Thor weened the iron
had buried itself in Skrimner's temples. &quot;Methinks,&quot; quoth the
giant, rubbing his cheek, &quot;some moss hath fallen on my face!&quot;
Jack's invisible coat, his magic sword, and his shoes of
swiftness, are also undoubtedly borrowed from Northern
romance. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id41" id="id40">[20]</a></p>
<p>An incident very similar to the blows with the rat's tail
occurs in the story of the Brave Little Tailor, in Grimm; who
outwits a giant in several ingenious ways, one of which may be
described. On one occasion the giant wished to try the
strength of the tailor, by challenging him to carry a tree.
The latter said, &quot;Very well, you carry the butt-end, while I
will carry all the branches, by far the heaviest part of the
tree.&quot; So the giant lifted the tree up on his shoulders, and
the tailor very coolly sat on the branches while the giant
carried the tree. At length he was so tired with his load, he
was obliged to drop it, and the tailor, nimbly jumping off,
made belief as if he had been carrying the branches all the
time, and said: &quot;A pretty fellow you are, that can't carry a
tree!&quot;</p>
<p>The edition of Jack the Giant-killer here used was printed at
Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1711. The earliest in the British Museum
is dated 1809, nor does the Bodleian, I believe, contain a
copy of a more ancient type.</p>
<p>Jack and the Bean-stalk may be added to the series of English
nursery-tales derived from the Teutonic. The bean-stalk is a
descendant of the wonderful ash in the Edda. The distich put
into the mouth of the giant,</p>

<p>In the reign of King Arthur, and in the county of Cornwall, near to the
Land's End of England, there lived a wealthy farmer, who had an only son
named Jack. He was brisk, and of a lively ready wit, so that whatever he
could not perform by force and strength, he accomplished by ingenious
wit and policy. Never was any person heard of that could worst him, and
he very often even baffled the learned by his sharp and ready
inventions.</p>
<p>In those days the Mount of Cornwall was kept by a huge and monstrous
giant of eighteen feet in height, and about three yards in compass, of a
fierce and grim countenance, the terror of all the neighbouring towns
and villages. He inhabited a cave in the middle of the mount, and he was
such a selfish monster that he would not suffer any one to live near
him. He fed on other men's cattle, which often became his prey, for
whensoever he wanted food, he would wade over to the main land, where he
would furnish himself with whatever came in his way. The inhabitants, at
his approach, forsook their habitations, while he seized on their
cattle, making nothing of carrying half-a-dozen oxen on his back at a
time; and as for their sheep and hogs, he would tie them round his waist
like a bunch of bandoleers. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id43" id="id42">[21]</a> This course he had followed for many
years, so that a great part of the county was impoverished by his

present at the town-hall when the authorities were consulting about the
giant, had the curiosity to ask what reward would be given to the person
who destroyed him. The giant's treasure was declared as the recompense,
and Jack at once undertook the task.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish his purpose, he furnished himself with a horn,
shovel, and pickaxe, and went over to the Mount in the beginning of a
dark winter's evening, when he fell to work, and before morning had dug
a pit twenty-two feet deep, and nearly as broad, covering it over with
long sticks and straw. Then strewing a little mould upon it, it appeared
like plain ground. This accomplished, Jack placed himself on the side of
the pit which was furthest from the giant's lodging, and, just at the
break of day, he put the horn to his mouth, and blew with all his might,
Although Jack was a little fellow, and the powers of his voice are not
described as being very great, he managed to make noise enough to arouse
the giant, and excite his indignation. The monster accordingly rushed
from his cave, exclaiming, &quot;You incorrigible villain, are you come here
to disturb my rest? you shall pay dearly for this. Satisfaction I will
have, for I will take you whole and broil you for breakfast.&quot; He had no
sooner uttered this cruel threat, than tumbling into the pit, he made
the very foundations of the Mount ring again. &quot;Oh, giant,&quot; said Jack,
&quot;where are you now? Oh faith, you are gotten now into Lob's Pound, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id45" id="id44">[22]</a>
where I will surely plague you for your threatening words: what do you
think now of broiling me for your breakfast? will no other diet serve
you but poor Jack?&quot; Thus did little Jack tantalize the big giant, as a
cat does a mouse when she knows it cannot escape, and when he had tired
of that amusement, he gave him a heavy blow with his pickaxe on the very
crown of his head, which &quot;tumbled him down,&quot; and killed him on the spot.
When Jack saw he was dead, he filled up the pit with earth, and went to
search the cave, which he found contained much treasure. The
magistrates, in the exuberance of their joy, did not add to Jack's gains
from their own, but after the best and cheapest mode of payment, made a
declaration he should henceforth be termed <em>Jack the Giant-killer</em>, and
presented him with a sword and embroidered belt, on the latter of which
were inscribed these words in letters of gold:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Here's the right valiant Cornish man,</div>
<div class="line">Who slew the giant Cormelian.</div>

</table>
<p>The news of Jack's victory, as might be expected, soon spread over all
the West of England, so that another giant, named Thunderbore, hearing
of it, and entertaining a partiality for his race, vowed to be revenged
on the little hero, if ever it was his fortune to light on him. This
giant was the lord of an enchanted castle, situated in the midst of a
lonely wood. Now Jack, about four months after his last exploit, walking
near this castle in his journey towards Wales, being weary, seated
himself near a pleasant fountain in the wood, &quot;o'ercanopied with
luscious woodbine,&quot; and presently fell asleep. While he was enjoying his
repose, the giant, coming to the fountain for water, of course
discovered him, and recognised the hated individual by the lines written
on the belt. He immediately took Jack on his shoulders, and carried him
towards his enchanted castle. Now, as they passed through a thicket, the
rustling of the boughs awakened Jack, who was uncomfortably surprised to
find himself in the clutches of the giant. His terror was not diminished
when, on entering the castle, he saw the court-yard strewed with human
bones, the giant maliciously telling him his own would ere long increase
the hateful pile. After this assurance, the cannibal locked poor Jack in
an upper chamber, leaving him there while he went to fetch another giant
living in the same wood to keep him company in the anticipated
destruction of their enemy. While he was gone, dreadful shrieks and
lamentations affrighted Jack, especially a voice which continually
cried,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Do what you can to get away,</div>
<div class="line">Or you'll become the giant's prey;</div>
<div class="line">He's gone to fetch his brother, who</div>
<div class="line">Will kill, and likewise torture you.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This warning, and the hideous tone in which it was delivered, almost
distracted poor Jack, who going to the window, and opening a casement,
beheld afar off the two giants approaching towards the castle. &quot;Now,&quot;
quoth Jack to himself, &quot;my death or my deliverance is at hand.&quot; The
event proved that his anticipations were well founded, for the giants of
those days, however powerful, were at best very stupid fellows, and
readily conquered by stratagem, were it of the humblest kind. There
happened to be strong cords in the room in which Jack was confined, two
of which he took, and made a strong noose at the end of each; and while
the giant was unlocking the iron gate of the castle, he threw the ropes
over each of their heads, and then, before the giants knew what he was
about, he drew the other ends across a beam, and, pulling with all his
might, throttled them till they were black in the face. Then, sliding
down the rope, he came to their heads, and as they could not defend
themselves, easily despatched them with his sword. This business so
adroitly accomplished, Jack released the fair prisoners in the castle,
delivered the keys to them, and, like a true knight-errant, continued
his journey without condescending to improve the condition of his purse.</p>
<p>This plan, however honorable, was not without its disadvantages, and
owing to his slender stock of money, he was obliged to make the best of
his way by travelling as hard as he could. At length, losing his road,
he was belated, and could not get to any place of entertainment until,
coming to a lonesome valley, he found a large house, and by reason of
his present necessity, took courage to knock at the gate. But what was
his astonishment, when there came forth a monstrous giant with two
heads; yet he did not appear so fiery as the others were, for he was a
Welsh giant, and what he did was by private and secret malice under the
false show of friendship. Jack having unfolded his condition to the
giant, was shown into a bedroom, where, in the dead of night, he heard
his host in another apartment uttering these formidable words:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Though here you lodge with me this night,</div>
<div class="line">You shall not see the morning light:</div>
<div class="line">My club shall dash your brains out quite!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Say'st thou so,&quot; quoth Jack; &quot;that is like one of your Welsh tricks,
yet I hope to be cunning enough for you.&quot; He immediately got out of bed,
and, feeling about in the dark, found a thick billet of wood, which he
laid in the bed in his stead, and hid himself in a dark corner of the
room. Shortly after he had done so, in came the Welsh giant, who
thoroughly pummelled the billet with his club, thinking, naturally
enough, he had broken every bone in Jack's skin. The next morning,
however, to the inexpressible surprise of the giant, Jack came down
stairs as if nothing had happened, and gave him thanks for his night's
lodging. &quot;How have you rested,&quot; quoth the giant; &quot;did you not feel
anything in the night?&quot; Jack provokingly replied, &quot;No, nothing but a rat
which gave me two or three flaps with her tail.&quot; This reply was totally
incomprehensible to the giant, who of course saw anything but a joke in
it. However, concealing his amazement as well as he could, he took Jack
in to breakfast, assigning to each a bowl containing four gallons of
hasty pudding. One would have thought that the greater portion of so
extravagant an allowance would have been declined by our hero, but he
was unwilling the giant should imagine his incapability to eat it, and
accordingly placed a large leather bag under his loose coat, in such a
position that he could convey the pudding into it without the deception
being perceived. Breakfast at length being finished, Jack excited the
giant's curiosity by offering to show him an extraordinary sleight of
hand; so taking a knife, he ripped the leather bag, and out of course
descended on the ground all the hasty pudding. The giant had not the
slightest suspicion of the trick, veritably believing the pudding came
from its natural receptacle; and having the same antipathy to being
beaten, exclaimed in true Welsh, &quot;Odds splutters, hur can do that trick
hurself.&quot; The sequel may be readily guessed. The monster took the knife,
and thinking to follow Jack's example with impunity, killed himself on
the spot. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id47" id="id46">[23]</a></p>

<p>King Arthur's only son requested his father to furnish him with a large
sum of money, in order that he might go and seek his fortune in the
principality of Wales, where lived a beautiful lady possessed with seven
evil spirits. The king tried all he could do to persuade him to alter
his determination, but it was all in vain, so at last he granted his
request, and the prince set out with two horses, one loaded with money,
the other for himself to ride upon. Now, after several days' travel, he
came to a market-town in Wales, where he beheld a vast concourse of
people gathered together. The prince demanded the reason of it, and was
told that they had arrested a corpse for several large sums of money
which the deceased owed when he died. The prince replied that it was a
pity creditors should be so cruel, and said, &quot;Go bury the dead, and let
his creditors come to my lodging, and there their debts shall be
discharged.&quot; They accordingly came, but in such great numbers, that
before night he had almost left himself penniless.</p>
<p>Now Jack the Giant-killer happened to be in the town while these
transactions took place, and he was so pleased with the generosity
exhibited by the prince, that he offered to become his servant, an offer
which was immediately accepted. The next morning they set forward on
their journey, when, as they were just leaving the town, an old woman
called after the prince, saying, &quot;He has owed me twopence these seven
years; pray pay me as well as the rest.&quot; So reasonable and urgent a
demand could not be resisted, and the prince immediately discharged the
debt, but it took the last penny he had to accomplish it. This event,
though generally ridiculed by heroes, was one by no means overlooked by
the prince, who required all Jack's assuring eloquence to console him.
Jack himself, indeed, had a very poor exchequer, and after their day's
refreshment, they were entirely without money. When night drew on, the
prince was anxious to secure a lodging, but as they had no means to hire
one, Jack said, &quot;Never mind, master, we shall do well enough, for I have
an uncle lives within two miles of this place; he is a huge and
monstrous giant with three heads; he'll fight five hundred men in
armour, and make them flee before him.&quot; &quot;Alas!&quot; quoth the prince, &quot;what
shall we do there? He'll certainly chop us up at a mouthful. Nay, we are
scarce enough to fill his hollow tooth!&quot; &quot;It is no matter for that,&quot;
quoth Jack; &quot;I myself will go before, and prepare the way for you;
therefore tarry and wait till I return.&quot; Jack then rides off full speed,
and coming to the gate of the castle, he knocked so loud that the
neighbouring hills resounded like thunder. The giant, terribly vexed
with the liberty taken by Jack, roared out, &quot;Who's there?&quot; He was
answered, &quot;None but your poor cousin Jack.&quot; Quoth he, &quot;What news with my
poor cousin Jack?&quot; He replied, &quot;Dear uncle, heavy news.&quot; &quot;God wot,&quot;
quoth the giant, &quot;prithee what heavy news can come to me? I am a giant
with three heads, and besides thou knowest I can fight five hundred men
in armour, and make them fly like chaff before the wind.&quot; &quot;Oh, but,&quot;
quoth Jack, &quot;here's the prince a-coming with a thousand men in armour to
kill you, and destroy all that you have!&quot; &quot;Oh, cousin Jack,&quot; said the
giant, &quot;this is heavy news indeed! I will immediately run and hide
myself, and thou shalt lock, bolt, and bar me in, and keep the keys till
the prince is gone.&quot; Jack joyfully complied with the giant's request,
and fetching his master, they feasted and made themselves merry whilst
the poor giant laid trembling in a vault under ground.</p>
<p>In the morning, Jack furnished the prince with a fresh supply of gold
and silver, and then sent him three miles forward on his journey,
concluding, according to the story-book, &quot;he was then pretty well out of
the smell of the giant.&quot; Jack afterwards returned, and liberated the
giant from the vault, who asked what he should give him for preserving
the castle from destruction. &quot;Why,&quot; quoth Jack, &quot;I desire nothing but
the old coat and cap, together with the old rusty sword and slippers
which are at your bed's head.&quot; Quoth the giant, &quot;Thou shalt have them,
and pray keep them for my sake, for they are things of excellent use;
the coat will keep you invisible, the cap will furnish you with
knowledge, the sword cuts asunder whatever you strike, and the shoes are
of extraordinary swiftness. These may be serviceable to you: therefore
take them with all my heart.&quot;</p>
<p>Jack was delighted with these useful presents, and having overtaken his
master, they quickly arrived at the lady's house, who, finding the
prince to be a suitor, prepared a splendid banquet for him. After the
repast was concluded, she wiped his mouth with a handkerchief, and then
concealed it in her dress, saying, &quot;You must show me that handkerchief
to-morrow morning, or else you will lose your head.&quot; The prince went to
bed in great sorrow at this hard condition, but fortunately Jack's cap
of knowledge instructed him how it was to be fulfilled. In the middle of
the night she called upon her familiar <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id49" id="id48">[24]</a> to carry her to the evil
spirit. Jack immediately put on his coat of darkness, and his shoes of
swiftness, and was there before her, his coat rendering him invisible.
When she entered the lower regions, she gave the handkerchief to the
spirit, who laid it upon a shelf, whence Jack took it, and brought it to
his master, who showed it to the lady the next day, and so saved his
life. The next evening at supper she saluted the prince, telling him he
must show her the lips tomorrow morning that she kissed last this night,
or lose his head. He replied, &quot;If you kiss none but mine, I will.&quot; &quot;That
is neither here nor there,&quot; said she, &quot;if you do not, death is your
portion!&quot; At midnight she went below as before, and was angry with the
spirit for letting the handkerchief go: &quot;But now,&quot; quoth she, &quot;I will be
too hard for the prince, for I will kiss thee, and he is to show me thy
lips.&quot; She did so, and Jack, who was standing by, cut off the spirit's
head, and brought it under his invisible coat to his master, who
produced it triumphantly the next morning before the lady. This feat
destroyed the enchantment, the evil spirits immediately forsook her, and
she appeared still more sweet and lovely, beautiful as she was before.
They were married the next morning, and shortly afterwards went to the
court of King Arthur, where Jack, for his eminent services, was created
one of the knights of the Round Table.</p>

<p>Our hero, having been successful in all his undertakings, and resolving
not to remain idle, but to perform what services he could for the honour
of his country, humbly besought his majesty to fit him out with a horse
and money to enable him to travel in search of new adventures; for, said
he, &quot;there are many giants yet living in the remote part of Wales, to
the unspeakable damage of your majesty's subjects; wherefore may it
please you to encourage me, I do not doubt but in a short time to cut
them off root and branch, and so rid all the realm of those giants and
monsters in human shape.&quot; We need scarcely say that Jack's generous
offer was at once accepted. The king furnished him with the necessary
accoutrements, and Jack set out with his magical cap, sword, and shoes,
the better to perform the dangerous enterprises which now lay before
him.</p>
<p>After travelling over several hills and mountains, the country through
which he passed offering many impediments to travellers, on the third
day he arrived at a very large wood, which he had no sooner entered than
his ears were assailed with piercing shrieks. Advancing softly towards
the place where the cries appeared to proceed from, he was horror-struck
at perceiving a huge giant dragging along a fair lady, and a knight her
husband, by the hair of their heads, &quot;with as much ease,&quot; says the
original narrative, &quot;as if they had been a pair of gloves.&quot; Jack shed
tears of pity on the fate of this hapless couple, but not suffering his
feelings to render him neglectful of action, he put on his invisible
coat, and taking with him his infallible sword, succeeded, after
considerable trouble, and many cuts, to despatch the monster, whose
dying groans were so terrible, that they made the whole wood ring again.
The courteous knight and his fair lady were overpowered with gratitude,
and, after returning Jack their best thanks, they invited him to their
residence, there to recruit his strength after the frightful encounter,
and receive more substantial demonstrations of their obligations to him.
Jack, however, declared that he would not rest until he had found out
the giant's habitation. The knight, on hearing this determination, was
very sorrowful, and replied, &quot;Noble stranger, it is too much to run a
second hazard: this monster lived in a den under yonder mountain, with a
brother more fierce and cruel than himself. Therefore, if you should go
thither, and perish in the attempt, it would be a heart-breaking to me
and my lady: let me persuade you to go with us, and desist from any
further pursuit.&quot; The knight's reasoning had the very opposite effect
that was intended, for Jack, hearing of another giant, eagerly embraced
the opportunity of displaying his skill, promising, however, to return
to the knight when he had accomplished his second labour.</p>
<p>He had not ridden more than a mile and a half, when the cave mentioned
by the knight appeared to view, near the entrance of which he beheld the
giant, sitting upon a block of timber, with a knotted iron club by his
side, waiting, as he supposed, for his brother's return with his
barbarous prey. This giant is described as having &quot;goggle eyes like
flames of fire, a countenance grim and ugly, cheeks like a couple of
large flitches of bacon, the bristles of his beard resembling rods of
iron wire, and locks that hung down upon his brawny shoulders like
curled snakes or hissing adders.&quot; Jack alighted from his horse, and
putting on the invisible coat, approached near the giant, and said
softly, &quot;Oh! are you there? it will not be long ere I shall take you
fast by the beard.&quot; The giant all this while could not see him, on
account of his invisible coat, so that Jack, coming up close to the
monster, struck a blow with his sword at his head, but unfortunately
missing his aim, he cut off the nose instead. The giant, as we may
suppose, &quot;roared like claps of thunder,&quot; and began to lay about him in
all directions with his iron club so desperately, that even Jack was
frightened, but exercising his usual ingenuity, he soon despatched him.
After this, Jack cut off the giant's head, and sent it, together with
that of his brother, to King Arthur, by a waggoner he hired for that
purpose, who gave an account of all his wonderful proceedings.</p>
<p>The redoubtable Jack next proceeded to search the giant's cave in search
of his treasure, and passing along through a great many winding
passages, he came at length to a large room paved with freestone, at the
upper end of which was a boiling caldron, and on the right hand a large
table, at which the giants usually dined. After passing this
dining-room, he came to a large and well-secured den filled with human
captives, who were fattened and taken at intervals for food, as we do
poultry. Jack set the poor prisoners at liberty, and, to compensate them
for their sufferings and dreadful anticipations, shared the giant's
treasure equally amongst them, and sent them to their homes overjoyed at
their unexpected deliverance.</p>
<p>It was about sunrise when Jack, after the conclusion of this adventure,
having had a good night's rest, mounted his horse to proceed on his
journey, and, by the help of directions, reached the knight's house
about noon. He was received with the most extraordinary demonstrations
of joy, and his kind host, out of respect to Jack, prepared a feast
which lasted many days, all the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood
being invited to it. The knight related the hero's adventures to his
assembled guests, and presented him with a beautiful ring, on which was
engraved a representation of the giant dragging the distressed knight
and his lady, with this motto:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">We were in sad distress you see,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Under the giant's fierce command,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">But gain'd our lives and liberty</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">By valiant Jack's victorious hand.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>But earthly happiness is not generally of long duration, and so in some
respects it proved on the present occasion, for in the midst of the
festivities arrived a messenger with the dismal intelligence that one
Thunderdell, a giant with two heads, having heard of the death of his
two kinsmen, came from the north to be revenged on Jack, and was already
within a mile of the knight's house, the country people flying before
him in all directions. The intelligence had no effect on the dauntless
Jack, who immediately said, &quot;Let him come! I have a tool to pick his
teeth;&quot; and with this elegant assertion, he invited the guests to
witness his performance from a high terrace in the garden of the castle.</p>
<p>It is now necessary to inform the reader that the knight's house or
castle was situated in an island encompassed with a moat thirty feet
deep, and twenty feet wide, passable by a drawbridge. Now Jack,
intending to accomplish his purpose by a clever stratagem, employed men
to cut through this drawbridge on both sides nearly to the middle; and
then, dressing himself in his invisible coat, he marched against the
giant with his well-tried sword. As he approached his adversary,
although invisible, the giant, being, as it appears, an epicure in such
matters, was aware of his approach, and exclaimed, in a fearful tone of
voice—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Fi, fee, fo, fum! <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id51" id="id50">[25]</a></div>

</table>
<p>&quot;Say you so,&quot; said Jack; &quot;then you are a monstrous miller indeed.&quot; The
giant, deeply incensed, replied, &quot;Art thou that villain who killed my
kinsman? then I will tear thee with my teeth, and grind thy bones to
powder.&quot; &quot;But,&quot; says Jack, still provoking him, &quot;you must catch me
first, if you please:&quot; so putting aside his invisible coat, so that the
giant might see him, and putting on his wonderful shoes, he enticed him
into a chase by just approaching near enough to give him an apparent
chance of capture. The giant, we are told, &quot;followed like a walking
castle, so that the very foundations of the earth seemed to shake at
every step.&quot; Jack led him a good distance, in order that the wondering
guests at the castle might see him to advantage, but at last, to end the
matter, he ran over the drawbridge, the giant pursuing him with his
club; but coming to the place where the bridge was cut, the giant's
great weight burst it asunder, and he was precipitated into the moat,
where he rolled about, says the author, &quot;like a vast whale.&quot; While the
monster was in this condition, Jack sadly bantered him about the boast
he had made of grinding his bones to powder, but at length, having
teased him sufficiently, a cart-rope was cast over the two heads of the
giant, and he was drawn ashore by a team of horses, where Jack served
him as he had done his relatives, cut off his heads, and sent them to
King Arthur.</p>
<p>It would seem that the giant-killer rested a short time after this
adventure, but he was soon tired of inactivity, and again went in search
of another giant, the last whose head he was destined to chop off. After
passing a long distance, he came at length to a large mountain, at the
foot of which was a very lonely house. Knocking at the door, it was
opened by &quot;an ancient <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id53" id="id52">[26]</a> man, with a head as white as snow,&quot; who
received Jack very courteously, and at once consented to his request for
a lodging. Whilst they were at supper, the old man, who appears to have
known more than was suspected, thus addressed the hero: &quot;Son, I am
sensible you are a conqueror of giants, and I therefore inform you that
on the top of this mountain is an enchanted castle, maintained by a
giant named Galligantus, who, by the help of a conjuror, gets many
knights into his castle, where they are transformed into sundry shapes
and forms: but, above all, I especially lament a duke's daughter, whom
they took from her father's garden, bringing her through the air in a
chariot drawn by fiery dragons, and securing her within the castle
walls, transformed her into the shape of a hind. Now, though a great
many knights have endeavoured to break the enchantment, and work her
deliverance, yet no one has been able to accomplish it, on account of
two fiery griffins which are placed at the gate, and which destroyed
them at their approach; but you, my son, being furnished with an
invisible coat, may pass by them undiscovered, and on the gates of the
castle you will find engraven in large characters by what means the
enchantment may be broken.&quot; The undaunted Jack at once accepted the
commission, and pledged his faith to the old man to proceed early in the
morning on this new adventure.</p>

<p>In the morning, as soon as it was daylight, Jack put on his invisible
coat, and prepared himself for the enterprise. When he had reached the
top of the mountain, he discovered the two fiery griffins, but, being

reached the gate of the castle, he noticed a golden trumpet attached to
it, under which were written in large characters the following lines:</p>

<p>Jack at once accepted the challenge, and putting the trumpet to his
mouth, gave a blast that made the hills re-echo. The castle trembled to
its foundations, and the giant and conjuror were overstricken with fear,
knowing that the reign of their enchantments was at an end. The former
was speedily slain by Jack, but the conjuror, mounting up into the air,
was carried away in a whirlwind, and never heard of more. The
enchantments were immediately broken, and all the lords and ladies, who
had so long been cruelly transformed, were standing on the native earth
in their natural shapes, the castle having vanished with the conjuror.</p>
<p>The only relic of the giant which was left was the head, which Jack cut
off in the first instance, and which we must suppose rolled away from
the influence of the enchanted castle, or it would have &quot;vanished into
thin air&quot; with the body. It was fortunate that it did so, for it proved
an inestimable trophy at the court of King Arthur, where Jack the
Giant-killer was shortly afterwards united to the duke's daughter whom
he had freed from enchantment, &quot;not only to the joy of the court, but of
all the kingdom.&quot; To complete his happiness, he was endowed with a noble
house and estates, and his <em>penchant</em> for giant-killing having subsided,
or, what is more probable, no more monsters appearing to interrupt his
tranquillity, he accomplished the usual conclusion to these romantic
narratives, by passing the remainder of his life in the enjoyment of
every domestic felicity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I have alluded to the quotation from this primitive romance
made by Shakespeare in King Lear, but if the story of Rowland,
published by Mr. Jamieson, is to be trusted, it would seem
that the great dramatist was indebted to a ballad of the time.
This position would, however, compel us to adopt the belief
that the words of the giant are also taken from the ballad; a
supposition to which I am most unwilling to assent. In fact, I
believe that Edgar quotes from two different compositions, the
first line from a ballad on Rowland, the second from Jack and
the Giants. &quot;And Rowland into the castle came&quot; is a line in
the second ballad of Rosmer Hafmand, or the Merman Rosmer, in
the Danish <em>Koempe Viser</em>, p. 165. The story alluded to above
may be briefly given as follows.</p>
<p>The sons of King Arthur were playing at ball in the merry town
of Carlisle, and their sister, &quot;Burd <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id59" id="id56">[28]</a> Ellen&quot; was in the
midst of them. Now it happened that Child Rowland gave the
ball such a powerful kick with his foot that &quot;o'er the kirk he
gar'd it flee.&quot; Burd Ellen went round about in search of the
ball, but what was the consternation of her brothers when they
found that she did not return, although &quot;they bade lang and ay
langer,&quot;—</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">They sought her east, they sought her west,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">They sought her up and down;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And wae were the hearts in merry Carlisle,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For she was nae gait found.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At last her eldest brother went to the Warlock or Wizard
Merlin, and asked him if he knew where his sister, the fair
Burd Ellen, was. &quot;The fair Burd Ellen,&quot; said the Warlock
Merlin, &quot;is carried away by the fairies, and is now in the
castle of the King of Elfland; and it were too bold an
undertaking for the stoutest knight in Christendom to bring
her back.&quot; The brother, however, insisted upon undertaking the
enterprise, and after receiving proper instructions from
Merlin, which he failed in observing, he set out on his
perilous expedition, and was never more seen.</p>
<p>The other brothers took the same course, and shared a similar
fate, till it came to the turn of Child Rowland, who with
great difficulty obtained the consent of his mother, for Queen
Guinever began to be afraid of losing all her children.
Rowland, having received her blessing, girt on his father's
celebrated sword Excaliber, that never struck in vain, and
repaired to Merlin's cave. The wizard gave him all necessary
instructions for his journey and conduct, the most important
of which were that he should kill every person he met with
after entering the land of Faerie, and should neither eat nor
drink of what was offered him in that country, whatever his
hunger or thirst might be; for if he tasted or touched in
Elfland, he must remain in the power of the elves, and never
see middle-earth again.</p>
<p>Child Rowland faithfully promised to observe the instructions
of Merlin, and he accordingly went to Elfland, where he found,
as the wizard had foretold, the king's horseherd feeding his
horses. &quot;Canst thou tell me,&quot; said Rowland, &quot;where the castle
of the king of Elfland is?&quot; &quot;I cannot,&quot; replied the horseherd,
&quot;but go a little further, and thou wilt come to a cowherd, and
perhaps he will know.&quot; When he had made this answer, Rowland,
remembering his instructions, took his good sword, and cut off
the head of the horseherd. He then went a little further, and
met with a cowherd, to whom he repeated the same question, and
obtained the same answer. Child Rowland then cut off the
cowherd's head, and having pursued exactly the same course
with a shepherd, goatherd, and a swineherd, he is referred by
the last to a hen-wife, who, in reply to his question, said,
&quot;Go on yet a little farther till you come to a round green
hill, surrounded with terraces from the bottom to the top: go
round it three times widershins, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id60" id="id57">[29]</a> and every time say,
&quot;Open door, open door, and let me come in!' and the third time
the door will open, and you may go in.&quot; Child Rowland
immediately cut off the hen-wife's head in return for her
intelligence, and following her directions, a door in the hill
opened, and he went in. As soon as he entered, the door closed
behind him, and he traversed a long passage, which was dimly
but pleasantly lighted by crystallized rock, till he came to
two wide and lofty folding-doors, which stood ajar. He opened
them, and entered an immense hall, which seemed nearly as big
as the hill itself. It was the most magnificent apartment in
all the land of Faerie, for the pillars were of gold and
silver, and the keystones ornamented with clusters of
diamonds. A gold chain hung from the middle of the roof,
supporting an enormous lamp composed of one hollowed
transparent pearl, in the midst of which was a large magical
carbuncle that beautifully illumined the whole of the hall.</p>
<p>At the upper end of the hall, seated on a splendid sofa, under
a rich canopy, was his sister the Burd Ellen, &quot;kembing her
yellow hair wi' a silver kemb,&quot; who immediately perceiving
him, was sorrow-struck at the anticipation of his being
destroyed by the king of Elfland,—</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And hear ye this, my youngest brither,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Why badena ye not at hame?</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Had ye a hunder and thousand lives,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Ye canna brook ane o' them.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>And she informs him that he will certainly lose his life if
the king finds him in the hall. A long conversation then takes
place, and Rowland tells her all his adventures, concluding
his narrative with the observation that, after his long
journey, he is <em>very hungry</em>.</p>
<p>On this the Burd Ellen shook her head, and looked sorrowfully
at him; but, impelled by her enchantment, she rose up, and
procured him a golden bowl full of bread and milk. It was then
that the Child Rowland remembered the instructions of the
Warlock Merlin, and he passionately exclaimed, &quot;Burd Ellen, I
will neither eat nor drink till I set thee free!&quot; Immediately
this speech was uttered, the folding-doors of the hall burst
open with tremendous violence, and in came the king of
Elfland,—</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">With, Fe, fi, fo, fum,</div>
<div class="line">I smell the blood of a Christian man!</div>
<div class="line">Be he dead, be he living, wi' my brand</div>
<div class="line">I'll clash his harns frae his harn-pan! <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id61" id="id58">[30]</a></div>
</div>
<p>&quot;Strike, then, Bogle, if thou darest,&quot; exclaimed the undaunted
Child Rowland, and a furious combat ensued, but Rowland, by
the help of his good sword, conquered the elf-king, sparing
his life on condition that he would restore to him his two
brothers and sister. The king joyfully consented, and having
disenchanted them by the anointment of a bright red liquor,
they all four returned in triumph to merry Carlisle.]</p>

[Tom Hickathrift belongs to the same series as Jack the
Giant-killer, one of the popular corruptions of old northern
romances. It seems to allude to some of the insurrections in
the Isle of Ely, such as that of Hereward, described in
Wright's Essays, ii. 91. Spelman, however, describes a
tradition, which he says was credited by the inhabitants of
Tylney, in which Hickifric appears as the assertor of the
rights of their ancestors, and the means he employed on the
occasion correspond with incidents in the following tale. The
entire passage is worth transcription. &quot;In Marslandia sitæ

</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In the reign before William the Conqueror, I have read in ancient
history that there dwelt a man in the parish of the Isle of Ely, in the
county of Cambridge, named Thomas Hickathrift, a poor labouring man, but
so strong that he was able to do in one day the ordinary work of two. He
had an only son, whom he christened Thomas, after his own name. The old
man put his son &quot;to good learning,&quot; but he would take none, for he was,
as we call them in this age, none of the wisest, but something soft, and
had no docility at all in him. God calling this good man, the father, to
his rest, his mother, being tender of him, maintained him by her hard
labour as well as she could; but this was no easy matter, for Tom would
sit all day in the chimney-corner, instead of doing anything to assist
her, and although at the period we are speaking of, he was only ten
years old, he would eat more than four or five ordinary men, and was
five feet and a half in height, and two feet and a half broad. His hand
was more like a shoulder of mutton than a boy's hand, and he was
altogether like a little monster, &quot;but yet his great strength was not
known.&quot;</p>
<p>Tom's strength came to be known in this manner. His mother, it appears,
as well as himself, for they lived in the primitive days of merry old
England, slept upon straw. This was in character with the wretched mud
hovels then occupied by the labouring population, not half so good as
many pigsties are now-a-days. Now being a tidy old creature, she must
every now and then replenish her homely couch, and one day, having been
promised a &quot;bottle&quot; of straw by a neighbouring farmer, after
considerable entreaty, she prevailed on her son to go to fetch it. Tom,
however, made her borrow a cart-rope first, before he would budge a
step, without condescending to enter into any explanation respecting the
use he intended it for; and the poor woman, too glad to obtain his
assistance on any terms, readily complied with his singular request.
Tom, swinging the rope round his shoulders, went to the farmer's, and
found him with two men, thrashing in a barn. Having mentioned the object
of his visit, the farmer somewhat inconsiderately told him he might take
as much straw as he could carry. Tom immediately took him at his word,
and, placing the rope in a right position, rapidly made up a bundle
containing at least a cartload, the men jeering him on the absurdity of
raising a pile they imagined no man could carry, and maliciously asking
him if his rope was long enough. Their merriment, however, was not of
long duration, for Tom flung the enormous bundle over his shoulders, and
walked away with it without any apparent exertion, much to the
astonishment and dismay of the master and his men.</p>
<p>After this exploit, Tom was no longer suffered to enjoy his idle
humours. Every one was endeavouring to secure his services, and we are
told many remarkable tales of his extraordinary strength, still more
wonderful than the one just related. On one occasion, having been
offered as great a bundle of firewood as he could carry, he marched off
with one of the largest trees in the forest! Tom was also extremely fond
of attending fairs; and in cudgelling, wrestling, or throwing the
hammer, there was no one who could compete with him. He thought nothing
of flinging a huge hammer into the middle of a river a mile off, and in
fact performed such extraordinary feats, that it was currently reported
throughout the country he had dealings with the Evil One.</p>
<p>Tom Hickathrift, too, was a very care-for-nothing fellow, and there were
very few persons in all the Isle of Ely who dared to give him an ill
word. Those who did paid very dearly for their impertinence, and Tom
was, in fact, paramount over his companions. His great strength,
however, caused him to be much sought after by those who were in want of
efficient labour, and at length a brewer at Lynn, who required a strong,
lusty fellow to carry his beer to the Marsh and to Wisbech, after much
persuasion, and promising him a new suit of clothes, and as much as he
liked to eat and drink, secured Tom for this purpose. The distance he
daily travelled with the beer was upwards of twenty miles, for although
there was a shorter cut through the Marsh, no one durst go that way for
fear of a monstrous giant, who was lord of a portion of the district,
and who killed or made slaves of every one he could lay his hands upon.</p>
<p>Now in the course of time, Tom was thoroughly tired of going such a
roundabout way, and without communicating his purpose to any one, he was
resolved to pass through the giant's domain, or lose his life in the
attempt. This was a bold undertaking, but good living had so increased
Tom's strength and courage, that, venturesome as he was before, his
hardiness was so much increased that he would have faced a still greater
danger. He accordingly drove his cart in the forbidden direction,
flinging the gates wide open, as if for the purpose of making his daring
more conspicuous. At length he was espied by the giant, who was
indignant at his boldness, but consoled himself with the reflection that
Tom and the beer would soon become his prey. &quot;Sirrah,&quot; said the monster,
&quot;who gave you permission to come this way? Do you not know how I make
all stand in fear of me? and you, like an impudent rogue, must come and
fling my gates open at your pleasure! How dare you presume to do so? Are
you careless of your life? Do not you care what you do? But I will make
you an example for all rogues under the sun! Dost thou not see how many
thousand heads hang upon yonder tree, heads of those who have offended
against my laws; but thy head shall hang higher than all the rest for an
example!&quot; But Tom made him this impudent answer, &quot;A dishclout in your
teeth for your news, for you shall not find me to be one of them!&quot; &quot;No!&quot;
said the giant, in astonishment and indignation; &quot;and what a fool you
must be if you come to fight with such a one as I am, and bring never a
weapon to defend yourself!&quot; Quoth Tom, &quot;I have a weapon here will make
you know you are a traitorly rogue.&quot; This impertinent speech highly
incensed the giant, who immediately ran to his cave for his club,
intending to dash out Tom's brains at one blow. Tom was now much
distressed for a weapon, that necessary accoutrement in his expedition
having by some means escaped his memory, and he began to reflect how
very little his whip would avail him against a monster twelve feet in
height, and six feet round the waist, small dimensions certainly for a
giant, but sufficient to be formidable. But while the giant was gone for
his club, Tom bethought himself, and turning his cart upside down,
adroitly takes out the axletree, which would serve him for a staff, and
removing a wheel, adapts it to his arm in lieu of a shield; very good
weapons indeed in time of trouble, and worthy of Tom's ingenuity. When
the monster returned with his club, he was amazed to see the weapons
with which Tom had armed himself, but uttering a word of defiance, he
bore down upon the poor fellow with such heavy strokes, that it was as
much as Tom could do to defend himself with his wheel. Tom, however, at
length managed to give the giant <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id63" id="id62">[31]</a> a heavy blow with the axletree on
the side of his head, that he nearly reeled over. &quot;What!&quot; said Tom, &quot;are
you tipsy with my strong beer already?&quot; This inquiry did not, as we may
suppose, mollify the giant, who laid on his blows so sharply and heavily
that Tom was obliged to act on the defensive. By and by, not making any
impression on the wheel, he got almost tired out, and was obliged to ask
Tom if he would let him drink a little, and then he would fight again.
&quot;No,&quot; said Tom, &quot;my mother did not teach me that wit; who would be fool
then?&quot; The sequel may readily be imagined, and Tom having beaten the
giant, and, disregarding his supplications for mercy, cut off his head,
entered the cave, which he found completely filled with gold and silver.</p>

</table>
<p>The news of this celebrated victory rapidly spread throughout the
country, for the giant had been a common enemy to the inhabitants. They
made bonfires for joy, and testified their respect to Tom by every means
in their power. A few days afterwards, Tom took possession of the cave
and all the giant's treasure. He pulled down the former, and built a
magnificent house on the spot; but with respect to the land forcibly
obtained by the giant, part of it he gave to the poor for their common,
merely reserving enough to maintain himself and his good old mother,
Jane Hickathrift. His treasure, we may suppose, notwithstanding this
great liberality, enabled him to maintain a noble establishment, for he
is represented as having numbers of servants, and a magnificent park of
deer. He also built a famous church, which was called St. James's,
because it was on that saint's day that he had killed the giant. And
what was as good and better than all this, he was no longer called Tom
Hickathrift by the people, but &quot;Mr. Hickathrift,&quot; a title then implying
a greater advancement in social position that can now scarcely be
imagined.</p>
<p>Like many other persons who have become suddenly possessed of great
wealth, Tom was sadly at a loss to know what to do with his money; nor
does this sage history condescend to inform us in what manner he
expended it. He seems, however, to have amused himself rarely, attending
every sport he could hear of for miles round, cracking skulls at
cudgel-playing, bear-baiting, and all the gentlemanly recreations
current in those days. At football he could scarcely have been a welcome
addition to the company, for one kick from his foot, if he caught it in
the middle, was sure to send the ball so great a distance over hedges
and trees that it was never seen again. Tom was, also, one evening
attacked by four robbers; but they sadly mistook the person they had to
deal with, for he quickly killed two of them, made the others sue for
mercy, and carried off their booty, which amounted to the large sum of
two hundred pounds. One would have thought the Hickathrifts were wealthy
enough before, but this addition to their store was, somehow or other, a
source of great delight and merriment to Tom's aged mother.</p>
<p>Tom was a long time before he found any one that could match him; but,
one day, going through his woods, he met with a lusty tinker, who had a
great staff on his shoulder, and a large dog to carry his bag and tools.
Tom was not particularly courteous; it may readily be supposed that his
unvarying successes had made him rather overbearing; and he somewhat
rudely asked the tinker what was his business there. But the tinker was
no man to succumb, and as rudely answered, &quot;What's that to you? Fools
must needs be meddling!&quot; A quarrel was soon raised, and the two laid on
in good earnest, blow for blow, till the wood re-echoed with their
strokes. The issue of the contest was long doubtful, but, the tinker was
so persevering, that Tom confessed he was fairly vanquished; and they
then went home together, and were sworn brothers in arms ever
afterwards. It happened, from the events that followed, to be a
fortunate occurrence.</p>
<p>In and about the Isle of Ely, many disaffected persons, to the number of
ten thousand and upwards, drew themselves up in a body, presuming to
contend for their ancient rights and liberties, insomuch that the gentry
and civil magistrates of the county were in great danger. The danger was
so great, that the sheriff was obliged to come to Tom Hickathrift, under
cover of the night, for shelter and protection, and gave him a full
account of the rebellion. The tinker and Tom immediately promised their
assistance, and they went out as soon as it was day, armed with their
clubs, the sheriff conducting them to the rendezvous of the rebels. When
they arrived there, Tom and the tinker marched up to the leaders of the
multitude, and asked them the reason of their disturbing the government.
To this they answered loudly, &quot;Our will is our law, and by that alone
will we be governed.&quot; &quot;Nay,&quot; quoth Tom, &quot;if it be so, these trusty clubs
are our weapons, and by them alone you shall be chastised.&quot; These words
were no sooner uttered, than they madly rushed on the immense multitude,
bearing all before them, laying twenty or thirty sprawling with every
blow. It is also related, as something rather remarkable, that the
tinker struck a tall man on the nape of the neck with such immense force
that his head flew off, and was carried forty feet from the body with
such violence that it knocked down one of the chief ringleaders, killing
him on the spot. The feats of Tom were no less wonderful; for, after
having slain hundreds, and at length broke his club, he seized upon &quot;a
lusty rawboned miller&quot; as a substitute, and made use of him as a weapon,
till he had quite cleared the field.</p>
<p>The king of course received intelligence of these extraordinary
exploits, and sent for the two heroes to his palace, where a royal
banquet was prepared for their honour and entertainment, most of the
nobility being present. Now after the banquet was over, the king made a
speech, neither too short nor too long, but having the extraordinary
merit of being much to the purpose. We cannot omit so remarkable a
specimen of royal eloquence. &quot;These, my guests,&quot; said the king, &quot;are my
trusty and well-beloved subjects, men of approved courage and valour;
they are the men that overcame and conquered ten thousand rebels who
were combined for the purpose of disturbing the peace of my realm.
According to the character I have received of Thomas Hickathrift and
Henry Nonsuch, my two worthy guests here present, they cannot be matched
in any other kingdom in the world. Were it possible to have an army of
twenty thousand such as these, I dare venture to assert I would act the
part of Alexander the Great over again. In the meanwhile, as a proof of
my royal favour, kneel down, Thomas Hickathrift, and receive the ancient
order of knighthood. And with respect to Henry Nonsuch, I will settle
upon him, as a reward for his great services, the sum of forty shillings
a year for life.&quot; After the delivery of this excellent address, the king
retired, and Tom and Henry shortly afterwards took their departure,
attended for many miles by a portion of the court.</p>
<p>When Sir Thomas Hickathrift returned home, he found, to his great
sorrow, that his mother had died during his stay at the court. It can
scarcely be said that he was inconsolable for her loss, but being &quot;left
alone in a large and spacious house, he found himself strange and
uncouth.&quot; He therefore began to consider whether it would not be
advisable to seek out for a wife, and hearing of a wealthy young widow
not far from Cambridge, he went and paid his addresses to her. At his
first coming, she appeared to favour his suit, but, before he paid her a
second visit, her fancy had been attracted by a more elegant wooer, and
Sir Thomas actually found him at her feet. The young spark, relying on
the lady's favour, was vehemently abusive to the knight, calling him a
great lubberly whelp, a brewer's servant, and a person altogether
unfitted to make love to a lady. Sir Thomas was not a likely man to
allow such an affront to go unpunished, so going out in the courtyard
with the dandy to settle the matter, he gave him a kick which sent him
over the tops of the houses into a pond some distance off, where he
would have been drowned, had not a poor shepherd, passing by, pulled him
out with his crook.</p>
<p>The gallant studied every means of being revenged upon the knight, and
for this purpose engaged two troopers to lie in ambush for him. Tom,
however, according to the story, &quot;crushed them like cucumbers.&quot; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id65" id="id64">[32]</a>
Even when he was going to church with his bride to be married, he was
set upon by one-and-twenty ruffians in armour; but, borrowing a
back-sword from one of the company, he laid about him with such
dexterity, that, purposely desiring not to kill any one, at every blow
he chopped off a leg or an arm, the ground being strewed with the
relics, &quot;as it is with tiles from the tops of the houses after a
dreadful storm.&quot; His intended and friends were mightily amused at all
this, and the fair one jokingly observed, &quot;What a splendid lot of
cripples he has made in the twinkling of an eye!&quot; Sir Thomas only
received a slight scratch, and he consoled himself for the trifling
misfortune by the conviction he had only lost a drop of blood for every
limb he had chopped off.</p>

<p>The marriage ceremony took place without any further adventure, and Sir
Thomas gave a great feast on the occasion, to which all the poor widows
for miles round were invited in honour of his deceased mother, and it
lasted for four days, in memory of the four last victories he had
obtained. The only occurrence at this feast worth mentioning was the
theft of a silver cup, which was traced to the possession of an old
woman of the name of Stumbelup, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id67" id="id66">[33]</a> and the others were so disgusted at
her ingratitude to their kind host, that she would have been hanged on
the spot, had not Sir Thomas interfered, and undertook the appointment
of the punishment. Nor was it otherwise than comical, for she was
condemned to be drawn through all the streets and lanes of Cambridge on
a wheelbarrow, holding a placard in her hands, which informed the
public,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

<p>The news of Tom's wedding soon reached the court, and the king,
remembering his eminent services, immediately invited him and his lady,
who visited their sovereign immediately, and were received by him most
affectionately. While they were on this visit, intelligence arrived that
an extraordinary invasion had taken place in the county of Kent. A huge
giant riding on a dragon, and accompanied with a large number of bears
and lions, had landed on the coast of that unfortunate county, and was
ravaging it in all directions. The king, says the history, was &quot;a little
startled,&quot; and well he might be, at such a visitation; but, taking
advantage of the opportune presence of Tom Hickathrift, he solved the
difficulty by creating him governor of the Isle of Thanet, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id69" id="id68">[34]</a> and thus
making him responsible for the protection of the inhabitants from this
terrible monster.</p>

Angles, now called the Isle of Thanet</em>, an error which favours the

original.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There was a castle in the island, from which the country was visible for
miles round, and this was the governor's abode. He had not been there
long before he caught a view of the giant, who is described as &quot;mounted
upon a dreadful dragon, with an iron club upon his shoulders, having but
one eye, the which was placed in his forehead; this eye was larger in
compass than a barber's bason, and appeared like a flame of fire; his
visage was dreadful to behold, grim and tawny; the hair of his head hung
down his back and shoulders like snakes of an enormous length; and the
bristles of his beard were like rusty wire!&quot; It is difficult to imagine
a being more terrible than this, but Tom was only surprised, not
frightened, when he saw one day the giant making his way to the castle
on his formidable dragon. After he had well viewed the edifice with his
glaring eye, he tied the dragon up to a tree, and went up to the castle
as if he had intended to thrust it down with his shoulder. But somehow
or other he managed to slip down, so that he could not extricate
himself, and Tom, advancing with his two-handed sword, cut off the
giant's head at one blow, and the dragon's at four, and sent them up in
a &quot;waggon&quot; to the court of his sovereign.</p>
<p>The news of Tom's victories reached the ears of his old companion, the
tinker, who became desirous of sharing in his glory, and accordingly
joined him at his castle. After mutual congratulations, Tom informed
him of his wish to destroy, without delay, the beasts of prey that
infested the island. They started for this purpose in company, Tom armed
with his two-handed sword, and the tinker with his long pikestaff. After
they had travelled about four or five hours, it was their fortune to
meet with the whole knot of wild beasts together, being in number
fourteen, six bears and eight lions. The two heroes waited for them with
their backs against a tree, and whenever they came &quot;within cutting
distance&quot; they cut their heads off, and in this manner killed all but
one lion, who, unfortunately, by an inconsiderate movement on the part
of Tom, crushed the poor tinker to death. The animal was, however,
ultimately slain by Sir Thomas.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Hickathrift had killed the giants, dragon, and lions, and he
had conquered the rebels, but his happiness was by no means completed,
for he was inconsolate for the loss of his friend. He, however, returned
home to his lady, and made a grand feast in commemoration of his
important victories. The history terminates with the following brilliant
metrical speech he made on this festive occasion:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id158">TOM THUMB.</a></h2>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>[Thumb stories are common in German and Danish, and the
English tale comprises much that is found in the Northern
versions. A writer in the Quarterly Review, xxi. 100, enters
into some speculations respecting the mythological origin of
Tom Thumb, and records his persuasion, in which we agree, that
several of our common nursery tales are remnants of ancient
μυθοι. Sir W. Scott mentions the Danish popular
history of Svend Tomling, analysed by Nierup, &quot;a man no bigger
than a thumb, who would be married to a woman three ells and
three quarters long.&quot; This personage is probably commemorated
in the nursery rhyme,</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I had a little husband</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">No bigger than my thumb:</div>
</div>
<div class="line">I put him in a pint-pot,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And there I bid him drum.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>According to popular tradition, Tom Thumb died at Lincoln, and
a little blue flagstone in the pavement of the cathedral used
to be pointed out as his monument.</p>
<p>&quot;It was my good fortune,&quot; says Dr. Wagstaffe, &quot;some time ago,
to have the library of a schoolboy committed to my charge,
where, among other undiscovered valuable authors, I pitched
upon Tom Thumb and Tom Hickathrift, authors indeed more proper
to adorn the shelves of Bodley or the Vatican, than to be
confined to the retirement and obscurity of a private study. I
have perused the first of these with an infinite pleasure, and
a more than ordinary application, and have made some
observations on it, which may not, I hope, prove unacceptable
to the public, and however it may have been ridiculed and
looked upon as an entertainment only for children and those of
younger years, may be found perhaps a performance not unworthy
the perusal of the judicious, and the model superior to either
of those incomparable poems of Chevy Chase or the Children in
the Wood. The design was undoubtedly to recommend virtue, and
to show that however any one may labour under the
disadvantages of stature and deformity, or the meanness of
parentage, yet if his mind and actions are above the ordinary
level, those very disadvantages that seem to depress him add a
lustre to his character.&quot;—<em>A Comment upon the History of Tom
Thumb</em>, 1711, p. 4.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the merry days of good King Arthur, there lived in one of the
counties of England a ploughman and his wife. They were poor, but as the
husband was a strong workman, and his partner an able assistant in all
matters pertaining to the farmhouse, the dairy, and poultry, they
managed to make a very good living, and would have been contented and
happy, had Nature blessed them with any offspring. But although they had
been married several years, no olive branch had yet appeared, and the
worthy couple sadly lamented their hard lot.</p>
<p>There lived at this period, at the court of Arthur, a celebrated
conjuror and magician, whose name was Merlin, the astonishment of the
whole world, for he knew the past, present, and future, and nothing
appeared impossible to him. Persons of all classes solicited his
assistance and advice, and he was perfectly accessible to the humblest
applicant. Aware of this, the ploughman, after a long consultation with
his &quot;better half,&quot; determined to consult him, and, for this purpose,
travelled to the court, and, with tears in his eyes, beseeched Merlin
that he might have a child, &quot;even though it should be no bigger than his
thumb.&quot;</p>
<p>Now Merlin had a strange knack of taking people exactly at their words,
and without waiting for any more explicit declaration of the ploughman's
wishes, at once granted his request. What was the poor countryman's
astonishment to find, when he reached home, that his wife had given
birth to a gentleman so diminutive, that it required a strong exercise
of the vision to see him. His growth was equally wonderful, for—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In four minutes he grew so fast,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">That he became as tall</div>
</div>
<div class="line">As was the ploughman's thumb in length,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And so she did him call.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The christening of this little fellow was a matter of much ceremony, for
the fairy queen, attended by all her company of elves, was present at
the rite, and he formally received the name of Tom Thumb. Her majesty
and attendants attired him with their choicest weeds, and his costume is
worth a brief notice. His hat was made of a beautiful oak leaf; his
shirt was composed of a fine spider's web, and his hose and doublet of
thistle-down. His stockings were made with the rind of a delicate green
apple, and the garters were two of the finest little hairs one can
imagine, plucked from his mother's eyebrows. Shoes made of the skin of a
little mouse, &quot;and tanned most curiously,&quot; completed his fairy-like
accoutrement.</p>
<p>It may easily be imagined that Tom was an object of astonishment and
ridicule amongst the other children of the village, but they soon
discovered that, notwithstanding his diminutive size, he was more than a
match for them. It was a matter of very little consequence to Tom
whether he lost or won, for if he found his stock of counters or
cherrystones run low, he soon crept into the pockets of his companions,
and replenished his store. It happened, on one occasion, that he was
detected, and the aggrieved party punished Tom by shutting him up in a
pin-box. The fairy boy was sadly annoyed at his imprisonment, but the
next day he amply revenged himself; for hanging a row of glasses on a
sunbeam, his companions thought they would follow his example, and, not
possessing Tom's fairy gifts, broke the glasses, and were severely
whipped, whilst the little imp was overjoyed at their misfortune,
standing by, and laughing till the tears run down his face.</p>
<p>The boys were so irritated with the trick that had been played upon
them, that Tom's mother was afraid to trust him any longer in their
company. She accordingly kept him at home, and made him assist her in
any light work suitable for so small a child. One day, while she was
making a batter-pudding, Tom stood on the edge of the bowl, with a
lighted candle in his hand, so that she might see it was properly made.
Unfortunately, however, when her back was turned, Tom accidentally fell
in the bowl, and his mother not missing him, stirred him up in the
pudding &quot;instead of minced fat,&quot; and put the pudding in the kettle with
Tom in it. The poor woman paid dearly for her mistake, for Tom had no
sooner felt the warm water, than he danced about like mad, and the
pudding jumped about till she was nearly frightened out of her wits, and
was glad to give it to a tinker who happened to be passing that way. He
was thankful for a present so acceptable, and anticipated the pleasure
of eating a better dinner than he had enjoyed for many a long day. But
his joy was of short duration, for as he was getting over a stile, he
happened to sneeze very hard, and Tom, who had hitherto remained silent,
cried out, &quot;Hollo, Pickens!&quot; which so terrified the tinker, that he
threw the pudding into the field, and scampered away as fast as ever he
could go. The pudding tumbled to pieces with the fall, and Tom, creeping
out, went home to his mother, who had been in great affliction on
account of his absence.</p>
<p>A few days after this adventure, Tom accompanied his mother when she
went into the fields to milk the cows, and for fear he should be blown
away by the wind, she tied him to a thistle with a small piece of
thread. While in this position, a cow came by, and swallowed him up:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But, being missed, his mother went,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Calling him everywhere:</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Where art thou, Tom? where art thou, Tom?</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Quoth he, Here, mother, here!</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">Within the red cow's stomach, here</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Your son is swallowed up;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">All which within her fearful heart</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Much woful dolour put.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The cow, however, was soon tired of her subject, for Tom kicked and
scratched till the poor animal was nearly mad, and at length tumbled him
out of her mouth, when he was caught by his mother, and carried safely
home.</p>
<p>A succession of untoward accidents followed. One day, Tom's father took
him to the fields a-ploughing, and gave him &quot;a whip made of a barley
straw&quot; to drive the oxen with, but the dwarf was soon lost in a furrow.
While he was there, a great raven came and carried him an immense
distance to the top of a giant's castle. The giant soon swallowed him
up, but he made such a disturbance when he got inside, that the monster
was soon glad to get rid of him, and threw the mischievous little imp
full three miles into the sea. But he was not drowned, for he had
scarcely reached the water before he was swallowed by a huge fish, which
was shortly after captured, and sent to King Arthur by the fisherman for
a new-year's gift. Tom was now discovered, and at once adopted by the
king as his dwarf;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Long time he liv'd in jollity,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Belov'd of the court,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And none like Tom was so esteem'd</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Amongst the better sort.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The queen was delighted with the little dwarf, and made him dance a
galliard on her left hand. His performance was so satisfactory, that
King Arthur gave him a ring which he wore about his middle like a
girdle; and he literally &quot;crept up the royal sleeve,&quot; requesting leave
to visit his parents, and take them as much money as he could carry:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And so away goes lusty Tom</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">With threepence at his back,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">A heavy burthen, which did make</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">His very bones to crack.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Tom remained three days with the old couple, and feasted upon a
hazel-nut so extravagantly that he grew ill. His indisposition was not
of long continuance, and Arthur was so anxious for the return of his
dwarf, that his mother took a birding-trunk, and blew him to the court.
He was received by the king with every demonstration of affection and
delight, and tournaments were immediately proclaimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Thus he at tilt and tournament</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Was entertained so,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">That all the rest of Arthur's knights</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Did him much pleasure show.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">And good Sir Launcelot du Lake,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Sir Tristram and Sir Guy,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Yet none compar'd to brave Tom Thumb</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In acts of chivalry.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Tom, however, paid dearly for his victories, for the exertions he made
upon this celebrated occasion threw him into an illness which ultimately
occasioned his death. But the hero was carried away by his godmother,
the fairy queen, into the land of Faerie, and after the lapse of two
centuries, he was suffered to return to earth, and again amuse men by
his comical adventures. On one occasion, after his return from
fairy-land, he jumped down a miller's throat, and played all manner of
pranks on the poor fellow, telling him of all his misdeeds, for millers
in former days were the greatest rogues, as everybody knows, that ever
lived. A short time afterwards, Tom a second time is swallowed by a
fish, which is caught, and set for sale at the town of Rye, where a
steward haggles for it,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Amongst the rest the steward came,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Who would the salmon buy,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And other fish that he did name,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But he would not comply.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">The steward said, You are so stout,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">If so, I'll not buy any.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">So then bespoke Tom Thumb aloud,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;Sir, give the other penny!&quot;</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">At this they began to stare,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To hear this sudden joke:</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Nay, some were frighted to the heart,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And thought the dead fish spoke.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">So the steward made no more ado,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But bid a penny more;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Because, he said, I never heard</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A fish to speak before.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The remainder of the history, which details Tom's adventures with the
queen, his coach drawn by six beautiful white mice, his escaping on the
back of a butterfly, and his death in a spider's web, is undoubtedly a
later addition to the original, and may therefore be omitted in this
analysis. It is, in fact, a very poor imitation of the first part of the
tale.</p>

<p>The most obvious method of arranging the rhymes employed in the
amusements of children is to commence with the simple lines used by the
nurse in the infantine toe, finger, and face-games, then proceeding to
bo-peep, and concluding with the more complicated games, many of the
latter possessing a dramatic character.</p>

<p>A game with the five toes, each toe being touched in succession as these
names are cried. &quot;This song affords a proof of the connexion between the
English and Scandinavian rhymes. The last line, as it now stands,
appears to mean nothing. The word <em>oker</em>, however, is the A.-S. æcer,
Icel. akr, Dan. ager, and Swed. åker, pronounced <em>oker</em>, a field, and
the flower is the field-bell.&quot;—Mr. Stephens's MS. The following lines
are also used in a play with the toes:</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, this will be considered more like the common rhyme,
&quot;Robert Barnes, Fellow fine,&quot; printed in the 'Nursery Rhymes of
England,' p. 166. An analogous verse is found in the nursery anthology
of Berlin (Kuhn, Kinderlieder, 229), and in that of Sweden (Lilja, p.
14),—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Sko, sko min lille häst,</div>
<div class="line">I morgon frosten blir' vår gäst,</div>
<div class="line">Då bli' hästskorna dyra,</div>
<div class="line">Två styfver för fyra.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Shoe, shoe my little horse,</div>
<div class="line">To-morrow it will be frosty:</div>
<div class="line">Then will horse-shoes be dear,</div>
<div class="line">Two will cost a stiver.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>English nurses use the following lines, when a child's shoe is tight,
and they pat the foot to induce him to allow it to be tried on:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Cobbler, cobbler, mend my shoe,</div>
<div class="line">Give it a stitch and that will do.</div>
<div class="line">Here's a nail, and there's a prod,</div>
<div class="line">And now my shoe is well shod.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, occasionally, these lines,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This pig went to market,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Squeak, mouse, mouse, mousey;</div>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And here's my own doll dowsy.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following lines are said by the nurse when moving the child's foot
up and down,—</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id160">THE FIVE FINGERS.</a></h2>
<p>I do not recollect to have seen anywhere noticed the somewhat singular
fact, that our ancestors had distinct names for each of the five
fingers—the thumb being generally called a finger in old works. Yet
such was the case; and it may not displease the reader to have these
cognominations duly set forth in order, viz. <em>thumb</em>, <em>toucher</em>,
<em>longman</em>, <em>leche-man</em>, <em>little-man</em>. This information is derived from a
very curious MS. quoted in my Dictionary of Archaisms, p. 357; and the
reasons for the names are thus set forth:—The first finger was called
<em>toucher</em> because &quot;therewith men touch i-wis;&quot; the second finger
<em>longman</em>, &quot;for longest finger it is,&quot; (this, I beg to say, is intended
for rhyme). The third finger was called <em>leche-man</em>, because a leche or
doctor tasted everything by means of it. This is very curious; though we
find elsewhere another reason for this appellation, on account of the
pulsation in it, which was at one time supposed to communicate directly
with the heart. The other finger was, of course, called <em>littleman</em>
because it was the least of all. It is rather curious that some of these
names should have survived the wrecks of time, and be still preserved
in a nursery-rhyme; yet such is the fact; for one thus commences, the
fingers being kept in corresponding movements:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Dance, thumbkin, dance,</div>
<div class="line">Dance, thumbkin, dance;</div>
<div class="line">Dance, ye merry men all around:</div>
<div class="line">But thumbkin he can dance alone;</div>
<div class="line">But thumbkin he can dance alone.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Dance, foreman, dance,</div>
<div class="line">Dance foreman, dance;</div>
<div class="line">Dance, ye merry men all around:</div>
<div class="line">But thumbkin he can dance alone;</div>
<div class="line">But thumbkin he can dance alone.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And so on, substituting in succession <em>middleone</em>, <em>longman</em>, or
<em>middleman</em>, <em>ringman</em>, and <em>littleman</em>, and each verse terminating with
&quot;thumbkin he can dance alone.&quot; In some instances the original name for
the third finger, <em>lecheman</em>, is preserved in the rhyme, but <em>ringman</em>
is most generally adopted.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark too, that there is, even at the present day,
amongst many of the old women of the Peak of Derbyshire, a strong belief
in the superiority of <em>lecheman</em> over <em>foreman</em> in all matters of taste.
They say that the forefinger is <em>venomous</em>, and that the superiority of
the third is to be ascribed to its being possessed of a <em>nerve</em>; and as
they appear to pay a most superstitious reverence to a nerve, whether in
the finger, the tooth, or the ear, they do not fail to impress upon
their daughters the importance of tasting anything of consequence with
the third finger.</p>
<p>The names given to the fingers vary considerably in the different
counties. In Essex they call them</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Tom Thumbkin,</div>
<div class="line">Bess Bumpkin,</div>
<div class="line">Bill Wilkin,</div>
<div class="line">Long Linkin,</div>
<div class="line">And little Dick!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And in some parts of Yorkshire,</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Tom Thumbkins,</div>
<div class="line">Bill Wilkins,</div>
<div class="line">Long Daniel,</div>
<div class="line">Bessy Bobtail,</div>
<div class="line">And little Dick.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar appellations for the fingers are common in Denmark. Thus,
Thiele, iii. 136,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Tommeltot,</div>
<div class="line">Slikkepot,</div>
<div class="line">Langemand,</div>
<div class="line">Guldbrand,</div>
<div class="line">Lille Peer Spilleman.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Little Peer Spilleman&quot; is &quot;little Peter the fiddler,&quot; not a bad name
for the little finger. A slight variation of this is current in
Sweden,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Tomme tott,</div>
<div class="line">Slicke pott;</div>
<div class="line">Långe man,</div>
<div class="line">Hjertlig hand;</div>
<div class="line">Lille, lille, lille, gullvive!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following song for the four fingers is obtained from Lancashire:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This broke the barn,</div>
<div class="line">This stole the corn,</div>
<div class="line">This got none:</div>
<div class="line">This went pinky-winky</div>
<div class="line">All the way home!</div>
</div>

<p>These lines are said to a very young child, touching successively for
each line the eye, nose, chin, tooth, tongue, and mouth. Sometimes the
following version is used:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Brow brinky,</div>

<div class="line">Mouth merry.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The most pleasing amusement of this kind is the game of &quot;face-tapping,&quot;
the nurse tapping each feature as she sings these lines,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Here sits the lord mayor (<em>forehead</em>),</div>
<div class="line-block">

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Chinchopper, chin (<em>chucking the chin</em>)!</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar songs are common in the North of Europe. A Danish one is given
by Thiele, iii. 130:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Pandebeen,</div>
<div class="line">Oisteen,</div>

<div class="line">Chin-tip,</div>
<div class="line">Dikke, dikke, dik!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The nurse, while repeating the last line, tickles the child under the
chin. A German version, now common at Berlin, is printed by M. Kuhn, in
his article on Kinderlieder, p. 237:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

<p>The following lines are repeated by the nurse when sliding her hand down
the child's face:</p>

<p>This is a famous song for a young child, the nurse dancing it on her
knee, and gradually increasing the ascent of the foot. Similar songs,
but differing considerably from the above, are given in the Swedish
nursery ballads of Arwidsson, iii. 489-91; the Danish of Thiele, iii.
130-2, iv. 176-7; and the German Wunderhorn, iii. 60-1. The following
pretty Swedish version is given from Mr. Stephens's MS. collections:</p>

<p>There are a great number of English variations of the above song,
differing very materially from one another. A second version may be
worth giving:</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="bo-peep">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id163">BO-PEEP.</a></h2>
<p>The children's game of bo-peep is as old as the hills, hiding from each
other, and saying,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Bo-Peep, Little Bo-Peep:</div>
<div class="line">Now's the time for hide and seek.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>But in ancient times the amusement appears to have been even of a
simpler character, and adopted by nurses before children are capable of
seeking recreation for themselves. Sherwood describes bo-peep as a
child's game, in which the nurse conceals the head of the infant for an
instant, and then removes the covering quickly. The Italians say <em>far
bau bau</em>, or <em>baco, baco</em>, which Douce thinks is sufficient to show a
connexion between the nurse's <em>boggle</em> or <em>buggy-bo</em>, and the present
expression. Shakespeare has condescended to notice the game, unless,
indeed, we suppose the term to have passed into a proverb. The reader
will recollect what Butler says of Sir Edward Kelly, the celebrated
conjuror,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Kelly did all his feats upon</div>
<div class="line">The devil's looking-glass, a stone:</div>
<div class="line">Where, <em>playing with him at bo-peep</em>,</div>
<div class="line">He solv'd all problems ne'er so deep.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The term bo-peep appears to have been connected at a very early period
with sheep. Thus in an old ballad of the time of Queen Elizabeth, in a
MS. in the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Halfe Englande ys nowght now but shepe,</div>
<div class="line">In everye corner they playe boe-pepe;</div>
<div class="line">Lorde, them confownde by twentye and ten,</div>
<div class="line">And fyll their places with Cristen men.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And every one is acquainted with the nursery rhyme which details the
adventures of 'Little Bo-peep,'—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Little Bo-peep has lost her sheep,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And can't tell where to find them:</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Leave them alone, and they'll come home,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And bring their tails behind them.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And dreamt she heard them bleating:</div>
</div>
<div class="line">But when she awoke, she found it a joke,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For they were still all fleeting.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Minsheu gives us a funny derivation of the word, which he says is no
other than the noise which chickens make when they come out of the
shell! I regret I have nothing better, certainly nothing so ingenious,
to offer to my philological readers. Letting that pass, I take the
opportunity of giving an anecdote respecting Ben Jonson and Randolph,
which affords another illustration of the analogy above mentioned. It is
taken from a manuscript of the seventeenth century, in the possession of
Mr. Stephens of Stockholm, who considers the volume to have been
transcribed before the year 1650.</p>
<p>&quot;Randolph havinge not soe much as ferry money, sought out Ben Johnson,
and comminge to a place in London where he and three more were
drinkinge, peeps in att the chamber doore. Ben Johnson espyinge him,
said, 'Come in, Jack Bo-peepe.' Randolph, beinge very thirsty, it beeing
then summer, and willinge to quench his thirst, willingly obeyed his
command. The company dranke untill it came to five shillings: every man
drawinge his money, Randolph made this motion, viz. that he that made
the first coppy of verses upon the reckoninge should goe scot-free. Ben
and all the rest, beeinge poetts, readily consented. Randolph,
surpassinge them in acutenesse, utter'd forthwith these followinge,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I, Jack Bo-peep,</div>
<div class="line">And you foure sheep,</div>

<div class="line">They then for sudden joy did weep,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And I for sorrow sung,</div>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id171">SLATE GAMES.</a></h2>
<p>Entertaining puzzles or exercises upon the slate are generally great
favorites with children. A great variety of them are current in the
nursery, or rather were so some years ago. The story of the four rich
men, the four poor men, and the pond, was one of these; the difficulty
merely requiring a zig-zag inclosure to enable it to be satisfactorily
solved.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a pond lying upon common land, which was
extremely commodious for fishing, bathing, and various other purposes.
Not far from it lived four poor men, to whom it was of great service;
and farther off, their lived four rich men. The latter envied the poor
men the use of the pond, and, as inclosure bills had not then come into
fashion, they wished to invent an inclosure-wall which should shut out
the poor men from the pond, although they lived so near it, and still
give free access to the rich men, who resided at a greater distance. How
was this done?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="game-of-the-cat">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id172">GAME OF THE CAT.</a></h2>
<p>This is another slate game, in which, by means of a tale and appropriate
indications on the slate, a rude figure of a cat is delineated. It
requires, however, some little ingenuity to accomplish it.</p>
<p>Tommy would once go to see his cousin Charles. [Here one draws T for
Tommy, and C for Charles, forming the forehead, nose, and mouth of the
cat.] But before he went, he would make walls to his house. [Here he
draws lines from the arms of the T to its foot, forming the cheeks of
the cat.] But then it smoked, and he would put chimneys to it. [Here he
inserts two narrow triangles on each arm of the T, forming the ears of
the cat.] But then it was so dark, he would put windows into it. [Here
he draws a small circle under each arm of the T, forming the eyes.] Then
to make it pretty, he would spread grass at the door. [Here he scratches
lines at the foot of the T, representing the cat's whiskers.] Then away
he went on his journey, but after a little while, down he fell. [Here he
draws down a line a little way from the foot of the T.] But he soon
climbed up again. [Here he draws a zig-zag horizontally from the foot of
the last line, and draws one up, forming with the last movement the
first foot of the cat.] Then he walks along again, but soon falls down
once more. [Here he draws a short horizontal line, and one downwards.]
He soon, however, got up again, as before, &amp;c. [The second leg is then
formed, and by similar movements the four legs of the cat appear.]
After thus falling down four times, Tommy determined to proceed more
firmly, and climbing up, he walks along [the back of the cat] another
way round till he comes to C. His journey is now accomplished, and an
animal, called by courtesy a cat, appears on the slate, &quot;the admiration
of all beholders.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="handy-dandy">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id173">HANDY-DANDY.</a></h2>
<p>This game is now played as follows:—a child hides something in one
hand, and then places both fists endways on each other, crying,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Handy-dandy riddledy ro,</div>
<div class="line">Which will you have, high or low?</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, sometimes, the following distich,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Handy-dandy, Jack-a-dandy,</div>
<div class="line">Which good hand will you have?</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The party addressed either touches one hand, or guesses in which one the
article (whatever it may be) is placed. If he guesses rightly, he wins
its contents; if wrongly, he loses an equivalent.</p>
<p>Some versions read <em>handy-pandy</em> in the first of these, with another
variation, that would not now be tolerated. This is one of the oldest
English games in existence, and appears to be alluded to in Piers
Ploughman, ed. Wright, p. 69:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Thanne wowede Wrong</div>
<div class="line">Wisdom ful yerne,</div>
<div class="line">To maken pees with his pens,</div>
<div class="line">Handy-dandy played.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Florio, in his World of Worlds, ed. 1611, p. 57, translates
<em>bazziciúre</em>, &quot;to shake between two hands, to play handie-dandie.&quot;
Miege, in his Great French Dictionary, 1688, says, &quot;Handy-dandy, a kind
of play with the hands, <em>sorte de jeu de main</em>;&quot; and Douce, ii. 167,
quotes an early MS., which thus curiously mentions the game: &quot;They hould
safe your children's patrymony, and play with your majestie, as men play
with little children at <em>handye-dandye, which hand will you have</em>, when
they are disposed to keep anythinge from them.&quot; Some of the commentators
on Shakespeare have mistaken the character of the game, from having
adopted Coles's erroneous interpretation of <em>micare digitis</em>. Sometimes
the game is played by a sort of sleight of hand, changing the article
rapidly from one hand into the other, so that the looker-on is often
deceived, and induced to name the hand into which it is apparently
thrown. This is what Shakespeare alludes to by changing places.</p>
<p>Pope, in his Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus, says that the game of
handy-dandy is mentioned by Plato; but if, as I suppose, he refers to a
well-known passage in the Lysis, the allusion appears somewhat too
indistinct to warrant such an assertion,—αστρα γαλιζοντας τε δη
και κεκοσμημενους ἁπαντας. ὁι μεν ουν πολλοι εν τη αυλῃ επαιζον εξω.
ὁι δε τινες του αποδυτηριου εν γωνιᾳ ηρτιαζον αστραγαλοις παμπολλοις,
εκ φορμισκων τινων προαιρουμενοι. A passage, however, in Julius
Pollux, ix. 101, referring to this, is rather more distinct, and may
allude to one form of the game.—Και μην και αρτιαζειν,
αστραγαλους εκ φορμισκων καθαιρομενους εν τῳ αποδυτηριῳ  τους παιδας,
ὁ Πλατων εφη. το δε αρτιαζειν εν αστραγαλων πληθει κεκρυμμενων ὑπο
ταιν χεροιν, μαντειαν ειχε των αρτιων η και περιττων. ταυτο δε τουτο
και κυαμοις, η καρυοις τε και αμυγδαλαις, ὁι δε και αργυριῳ πραττειν
ηξιουν, a passage which Meursius, de Ludis Græcorum, ed. 1625, p. 5,
thus partially translates, &quot;nempe ludentes sumptis in manu talis, fabis,
nucibus, amygdalis, interdum etiam nummis, interrogantes alterum
divinare jubebant.&quot; Here we have the exact game of handy-dandy, which
is, after all, the simple form of the odd and even of children.</p>
<p>Browne has a curious allusion to this game in Britannia's Pastorals,
i. 5,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Who so hath sene yong lads, to sport themselves,</div>
<div class="line">Run in a low ebbe to the sandy shelves,</div>
<div class="line">Where seriously they worke in digging wels,</div>

<p>A slightly dramatic character may be observed in this game, which was
obtained from Essex. Children form a ring, one girl kneeling in the
centre, and sorrowfully hiding her face with her hands. One in the ring
then says,—</p>
<blockquote>

<p>One would have thought that this tiresome repetition had been continued
quite long enough, but two other verses are sometimes added, introducing
<em>gentlemen</em> and <em>ladies</em> with the same questions, to both of which it is
unnecessary to say that the callous and hardhearted Mary Brown replies
with perfect indifference and want of curiosity. All versions, however,
conclude with the girls saying,—</p>
<blockquote>

<p>rushes with impetuosity to break the ring, and generally succeeds in
escaping the bonds that detain her from her imaginary love.</p>
<p>The Swedish ballad of the &quot;Maiden that was sold into Slavery,&quot; has a
similar dramatic character. (See an article by Mr. Stephens, on the
Popular Ballads and Songs of Sweden, in the Foreign Quarterly Review for
1840.) Another Swedish ballad, or ring-dance song, entitled, &quot;Fair
Gundela,&quot; is, however, more analogous to the above. A girl sits on a
stool or chair within a ring of dancers; and, with something in her
hands, imitates the action of rowing. She should have a veil on her
head, and at the news of her sweetheart's death, let it fall over her
face, and sink down, overwhelmed with sorrow. The ring of girls dance
round her, singing and pausing, and she sings in reply. The dialogue is
conducted in the following manner:</p>

<p>The veil is thrown on one side, her face beams with joy, the circle is
broken, and the juvenile drama concludes with merriment and noise. It is
difficult to say whether this is the real prototype of the English game,
or whether they are both indebted to a still more primitive original.
There is a poetical sweetness and absolute dramatic fervour in the
Swedish ballad we vainly try to discover in the English version. In the
latter, all is vulgar, common-place, and phlegmatic. Cannot we trace in
both the national character? Do we not see in the last that poetic
simplicity which has made the works of Andersen so popular and
irresistibly charming? It may be that the style pleases by contrast, and
that we appreciate its genuine chasteness the more, because we have
nothing similar to it in our own vernacular literature.</p>

<p>The children are seated and the following questions put by one of the
party, holding a twisted handkerchief or something of the sort in the
hand. The handkerchief was called hewley-puley, and the questions are
asked by the child who holds it. If one answered wrongly, a box on the
ear with the handkerchief was the consequence; but if they all replied
correctly, then the one who broke silence first had that punishment.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-diamond-ring">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id179">THE DIAMOND RING.</a></h2>
<p>Children sit in a ring or in a line, with their hands placed together
palm to palm, and held straight, the little fingers downmost between the
knees. One of them is then chosen to represent a servant, who takes a
ring, or some other small article as a substitute, between her two
palms, which are pressed flat together like those of the rest, and goes
round the circle or line, placing her hands into the hands of every
player, so that she is enabled to let the ring fall wherever she
pleases without detection. After this, she returns to the first child
she touched, and with her hands behind her exclaims,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">My lady's lost her diamond ring:</div>
<div class="line">I pitch upon you to find it!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The child who is thus addressed must guess who has the ring, and the
servant performs the same ceremony with each of the party. They who
guess right, escape; but the rest forfeit. Should any one in the ring
exclaim, &quot;I have it,&quot; she also forfeits; nor must the servant make known
who has the ring, until all have guessed, under the same penalty. The
forfeits are afterwards cried as usual.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-poor-soldier">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id180">THE POOR SOLDIER.</a></h2>
<p>Children form a half-circle, first choosing one of their number to
represent the poor soldier. The chief regulation is that none of the
players may use the words, <em>yes</em>, <em>no</em>, <em>black</em>, <em>white</em>, or <em>gray</em>. The
poor soldier traverses the semicircle, thus addressing each player,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Here's a poor soldier come to town!</div>
<div class="line">Have you aught to give him?</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer must of course be evasive, else there is a fine. He
continues, &quot;Have you a pair of trousers [or old coat, shoes, cap, &amp;c.]
to give me?&quot; The answer must again be evasive, or else another forfeit.
The old soldier then asks: &quot;Well, what colour is it?&quot; The reply must
avoid the forbidden colours, or another forfeit is the penalty. Great
ingenuity may be exhibited in the manner in which the questions and
answers are constructed, and, in the hands of some children, this is a
most amusing recreation. The forfeits are of course cried at the end of
the game.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-bramble-bush">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id181">THE BRAMBLE-BUSH.</a></h2>
<p>A ring-dance imitation-play, the metrical portion of which is not
without a little melody. The bramble-bush is often imaginative, but
sometimes represented by a child in the centre of the ring. All join
hands, and dance round in a circle, singing,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Here we go round the bramble-bush,</div>
<div class="line">—The bramble-bush, the bramble-bush:</div>
<div class="line">Here we go round the bramble-bush</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">On a cold frosty morning!</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>After the chanting of this verse is ended, all the children commence an
imitation of washing clothes, making appropriate movements with their
hands, and saying,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This is the way we wash our clothes,</div>
<div class="line">—Wash our clothes, wash our clothes:</div>
<div class="line">This is the way we wash our clothes</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">On a cold frosty morning!</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>They then dance round, repeating the first stanza, after which the
operation of drying the clothes is commenced with a similar verse, &quot;This
is the way we dry our clothes,&quot; &amp;c. The game may be continued almost <em>ad
infinitum</em> by increasing the number of duties to be performed. They are,
however, generally satisfied with mangling, <em>smoothing</em> or ironing, the
clothes, and then putting them away. Sometimes they conclude with a
general cleaning, which may well be necessary after the large quantity
of work that has been done:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This is the way we clean our rooms,</div>
<div class="line">—Clean our rooms, clean our rooms:</div>
<div class="line">This is the way we clean our rooms</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">On a cold frosty morning!</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And like good merry washing-women, they are not exhausted with their
labours, but conclude with the song, &quot;Here we go round the
bramble-bush,&quot; having had sufficient exercise to warm themselves on any
&quot;cold frosty morning,&quot; which was doubtlessly the result, we may observe
<em>en passant</em>, as a matter of domestic economy, aimed at by the author.
It is not so easy to give a similar explanation to the game of the
mulberry-bush, conducted in the same manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Here we go round the mulberry-bush,</div>
<div class="line">—The mulberry-bush, the mulberry-bush:</div>
<div class="line">Here we go round the mulberry-bush</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">On a sunshiny morning.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In this game, the motion-cries are usually &quot;This is the way we wash our
clothes,&quot; &quot;This is the way we dry our clothes,&quot; &quot;This is the way we make
our shoes,&quot; &quot;This is the way we mend our shoes,&quot; &quot;This is the way the
gentlemen walk,&quot; &quot;This is the way the ladies walk,&quot; &amp;c. As in other
cases, the dance may be continued by the addition of cries and motions,
which may be rendered pretty and characteristic in the hands of
judicious actors. This game, however, requires too much exercise to
render it so appropriate to the season as the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-game-of-dump">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id182">THE GAME OF DUMP.</a></h2>
<p>A boy's amusement in Yorkshire, in vogue about half a century ago, but
now, I believe, nearly obsolete. It is played in this manner. The lads
crowd round, and place their fists endways the one on the other, till
they form a high pile of hands. Then a boy who has one hand free, knocks
the piled fists off one by one, saying to every boy, as he strikes his
fist away, &quot;What's there, Dump?&quot; He continues this process till he comes
to the last fist, when he exclaims:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">What's there?</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Cheese and bread, and a mouldy halfpenny!</div>
<div class="line-block">

</div>
<div class="line">I put it on the shelf, and the cat got it.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Where's the cat?</div>

<div class="line">Upon the church-top cracking nuts, and you may go and eat the
shells; and <em>them as</em> speak first shall have nine nips, nine
scratches, and nine boxes over the lug!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Every one then endeavours to refrain from speaking, in spite of mutual
nudges and grimaces, and he who first allows a word to escape is
punished by the others in the various methods adopted by schoolboys. In
some places the game is played differently. The children pile their
fists in the manner described above; then one, or sometimes all of them
sing,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I've built my house, I've built my wall;</div>
<div class="line">I don't care where my chimneys fall!</div>

<p>The merriment consists in the bustle and confusion occasioned by the
rapid withdrawal of the hands.</p>

and clapping hands for the fourth line. They curtsey while saying &quot;this

answers,</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I cannot read one unless I read all,</div>
<div class="line">So pray, ——, deliver the ball.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Naming any child she pleases. If she guesses rightly the child who has
the ball takes her place as Queen. If wrongly, the child who has the
ball says,</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The ball is mine, and none of thine,</div>
<div class="line">So you, proud Queen, may sit on your throne,</div>
<div class="line">While we, your messengers, go and come.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, sometimes, these lines,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The ball is mine, and none of thine,</div>
<div class="line">You are the fair lady to sit on:</div>
<div class="line">And we're the black gipsies to go and come.</div>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id191">COUNTING-OUT RHYMES.</a></h2>
<p>The operation of counting-out is a very important mystery in many
puerile games. The boys or girls stand in a row, and the operator begins
with the counting-out rhyme, appropriating a word to each, till he comes
to the person who receives the last word, and who is accordingly &quot;out.&quot;
This operation is continued till there is only one left, who is the
individual chosen for the hero of the game, whatever it may be. The
following verses are selected from a host of rhymes employed for this
purpose:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">One-ery, two-ery,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Tick-ery, tee-vy;</div>

<p>Amongst the various devices to establish a royal road to infantine
learning, none are more ancient or useful than the rhymes which serve to
impress the letters of the alphabet upon the attention and memory of
children. As early as the fifteenth century, &quot;Mayster Benet,&quot; who was
rector of Sandon, in Essex, in 1440, and afterwards a prebend of St.
Paul's, composed or translated an alphabet-rhyme, which not only
professed to recall the memory of the letters, but at a time when the
benefit of clergy was in vogue, held out the inducement of providing
means for avoiding the punishment of death. The following copy is taken
from two versions in MS. Harl. 541, compared with each other:</p>
<p>&quot;Who so wyll be wyse and worshyp to wynne, leern he on lettur and loke

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id192">A. APPLE-PIE.</a></h2>
<p>Eachard, a learned clergyman of the Church of England, published a work
in 1671, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id75" id="id74">[36]</a> in which he condescends to illustrate his argument by a
reference to this celebrated history. Talking of the various modes of
preaching adopted by different sects, he proceeds in this manner: &quot;And
whereas it has been observed that some of our clergie are sometimes over
nice in taking notice of the meer words that they find in texts, so
these are so accurate as to go to the very <em>letters</em>. As suppose, sir,
you are to give an exhortation to repentance upon that of St. Matthew,
'Repent ye, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand:' you must observe that
<em>Repent</em> is a rich word, wherein every letter exhorts us to our
duty,—Repent, R. readily, E. earnestly, P. presently, E. effectually,
N. nationally, T. thoroughly. Again, Repent Roaringly, Eagerly,
Plentifully, Heavily (because of <em>h</em>), Notably, Terribly. And why not,
Repent Rarely, Evenly, Prettily, Elegantly, Neatly, Tightly? And also,
why not, A apple-pasty, B bak'd it, C cut it, D divided it, E eat it, F
fought for it, G got it, &amp;c. I had not time, sir, to look any further
into their way of preaching; but if I had, I am sure I should have found
that they have no reason to despise our church upon that account.&quot; The
worthy divine would have censured the sermon on Malt attributed to the
elder Dodd.</p>

<p>We thus find this nursery romance descending in all its purity for
nearly two centuries. It may be even older than the time of Charles II.,
for it does not appear as a novelty in the quotation we have just given.
Be this as it may, the oldest edition I know of was printed some
half-century since by Marshall, in Aldermary Churchyard, entitled &quot;The
Tragical Death of A. Apple-pye, who was cut in pieces and eat by
twenty-five gentlemen, with whom all little people ought to be very well
acquainted,&quot; which runs as follows:</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="line">X. Y. Z. and Ampersy-and,</div>
<div class="line">They all wish'd for a piece in hand.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">At last they every one agreed</div>
<div class="line">Upon the apple-pye to feed;</div>
<div class="line">But as there seem'd to be so many,</div>
<div class="line">Those who were last might not have any.</div>
<div class="line">Unless some method there was taken,</div>

<p>Then follows a woodcut of the pie, surrounded by a square of the
letters, though it is not very easy to perceive how the conditions of
the problem are to be fulfilled. The remainder of the book, a small
32mo., is occupied with &quot;A Curious Discourse that passed between the
twenty-five letters at dinner-time,&quot;—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

<div class="line">Says B, a little bit, but nice.</div>

<div class="line">Z sat as mute as any fish,</div>
<div class="line">While Ampersand he licked the dish.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The manner in which a practical moral good was to be inferred from this
doggerel is not very apparent, but Mr. Marshall had a way of his own in
settling the difficulty. The finale must not be omitted: &quot;Having
concluded their discourse and dinner together, I have nothing more to
add, but that, if my little readers are pleased with what they have
found in this book, they have nothing to do but to run to Mr. Marshall's
at No. 4, in Aldermary Churchyard, where they may have several books,
not less entertaining than this, of the same size and price. But that
you may not think I leave you too abruptly, I here present you with the
picture of the old woman who made the apple-pye you have been reading
about. She has several more in her basket, and she promises, if you are
good children, you shall never go supperless to bed while she has one
left. But as good people always ask a blessing of God before meals,
therefore, as a token that you are good, and deserve a pye, you must
learn the two following graces, the one to be said before the meals, the
other after; and the Lord's Prayer every night and morning.&quot; Two graces
and the Lord's Prayer conclude the tract.</p>

<p>A very favorite class of rhymes with children, though the solutions are
often most difficult to guess. Nursery riddle-rhymes are extremely

collections of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>—The dog's name was <em>Been</em>, and the name of the persons who met each
other was King. This riddle was obtained recently from oral tradition. I
observe, however, a version of it in MS. Harl. 1962, of the seventeenth
century.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The cuckoo and the gowk,</div>
<div class="line">The laverock and the lark,</div>
<div class="line">The twire-snipe, the weather-bleak;</div>
<div class="line">How many birds is that?</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>—Three, for the second name in each line is a synonyme. The cuckoo is
called a <em>gowk</em> in the North of England; the lark, a <em>laverock</em>; and the
twire-snipe and weather-bleak, or weather-bleater, are the same birds.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Hoddy-doddy,</div>
<div class="line">With a round black body!</div>
<div class="line">Three feet and a wooden hat;</div>
<div class="line">What's that?</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>—An iron pot. In the country, an iron pot with three legs, and a wooden
cover, the latter raised or put on by means of a peg at the top, is used
for suspending over a fire, or to place on the hearth with a wood fire.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Riddle me, riddle me, what is that</div>
<div class="line">Over the head and under the hat?</div>

<p>—Hair. From Kent.</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And three quarters of another.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">How much did each get?</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>—The fiddler's wife was the piper's mother. Each one therefore got ½
+ 1 + ¼ or 1-¾.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>—Greybeard, says Moor, Suffolk Words, p. 155, was the appropriate name
for a fine large handsome stone bottle, holding perhaps three or four,
or more gallons, having its handle terminating in a venerable Druidic
face. This riddle appears to be alluded to in MS. Harl. 7316, p. 61:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I'm a dull senseless blockhead, 'tis true, when I'm young,</div>

<p>—An equal. This riddle is well known in Sweden. The following version
was given me by Mr. Stephens:</p>

connected with A. S. wædl.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id194">THE DEMANDS JOYOUS.</a></h2>
<p>It is not generally known that many of our popular riddles are centuries
old. Yet such is the fact, and those whose course of reading has made
them acquainted with ancient collections are not unfrequently startled
by observing a quibble of the fifteenth or sixteenth century go the
round of modern newspapers as a new invention, or perhaps as an
importation from America! A few months ago, an instance of this species
of resuscitation took place in the publication of the question, &quot;Which
were made first, elbows or knees?&quot; This was an enigma current in England
in the time of Queen Elizabeth, and is found in a manuscript in the
British Museum written before the close of the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>The earliest collection of riddles printed in this country came from the
press of Wynkyn de Worde in the year 1511, in black letter, under the
title of the &quot;Demaundes Joyous.&quot; Only one copy of this tract, which was
&quot;imprynted at London, in Flete Strete, at the sygne of the Sonne,&quot; is
known to exist, and it is now preserved in the public library at
Cambridge. It is chiefly a compilation from an early French tract under
a similar title, but which is far more remarkable for its grossness. The
reader may be amused with the following specimens, and perhaps
recognise some of them as old favorites:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Demand.</em> Who bore the best burden that ever was borne?—<em>R.</em> The ass
on which our Lady rode when she fled with our Lord into Egypt. <em>D.</em> What
became of that ass?—<em>R.</em> Adam's mother did eat her. <em>D.</em> Who is Adam's
mother?—<em>R.</em> The earth.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> What space is from the surface of the sea to its greatest
depth?—<em>R.</em> A stone's cast.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> How many calves' tails behoveth to reach from the earth to the
sky?—<em>R.</em> No more but one, an' it be long enough.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> Which is the most profitable beast, and that which men eat
least of?—<em>R.</em> Bees.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> Which is the broadest water, and the least jeopardy to pass
over?—<em>R.</em> The dew.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> What thing is that which never was nor never will be?—<em>R.</em> A
mouse making her nest in a cat's ear.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> Why doth a dog turn himself thrice round before he layeth
down?—<em>R.</em> Because he knoweth not the bed's head from its foot.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> Why do men make an oven in the town?—<em>R.</em> For because they
cannot make the town in the oven.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> How may a man know or perceive a cow in a flock of
sheep?—<em>R.</em> By sight.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> What alms are worst bestowed that men give?—<em>R.</em> Alms to a
blind man, for he would willingly see him hanged by the neck that gave
it him.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> What thing is that which hath no end?—<em>R.</em> A bowl.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> What people be they that never go a-procession?—<em>R.</em> Those
that ring the bells in the mean time.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> What is that that freezeth never?—<em>R.</em> Hot water.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> What thing is that that is most likest unto a horse?—<em>R.</em>
That is a mare.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> What thing is that which is more frightful the smaller it
is?—<em>R.</em> A bridge.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> Why doth an ox lie down?—<em>R.</em> Because he cannot sit.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> How many straws go to a goose's nest?—<em>R.</em> None, for lack of
feet.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> Who slew the fourth part of the world?—<em>R.</em> Cain, when he
killed his brother Abel.</p>
<p><em>Demand.</em> What man is he that getteth his living backwards?—<em>R.</em> A
ropemaker.</p>
<p>The reader will please to recollect the antiquity of these, and their
curiosity, before he condemns their triviality. Let the worst be said of
them, they are certainly as good as some of Shakespeare's jokes, which
no doubt elicited peals of laughter from an Elizabethan audience. This
may be said to be only a negative kind of recommendation, and, indeed,
when we reflect on the apparent poverty of verbal humour in those days,
the wonder is that it could have been so well relished. The fact must be
that we often do not understand the greater part of the meaning intended
to be conveyed.</p>
<p>To revert to the lengthened transmission of jokes, I may mention my
discovery of the following in MS. Addit. 5008, in the British Museum, a
journal of the time of Queen Elizabeth. The anecdote, by some means,
went the round of the provincial press in 1843, as of modern
composition. &quot;On a very rainy day, a man, entering his house, was
accosted by his wife in the following manner: 'Now, my dear, while you
are wet, go and fetch me a bucket of water.' He obeyed, brought the
water and threw it all over her, saying at the same time, 'Now, my dear,
while you are wet, go and fetch another!'&quot;</p>

<p>Rhymes upon natural objects and rural sayings are perhaps more generally
interesting than any other relics of the popular anthology. They not
unfrequently contain scientific truths, and have been considered worthy
of examination by the philosopher; while the unlearned are often
contented to use them as substitutes for the barometer or Nautical
Almanac. We all recollect the story of Dr. Johnson, and the boy who
prophesied a shower when not a speck was to be seen in the sky. The
doctor, drenched with rain, hastened back to the lad, and offered him a
shilling if he would divulge the data of his prediction. &quot;Why, you zee,
zur, when that black ram holds its tail up, it be sure to rain!&quot; The
story loses none of its force when we find it in the Hundred Merry
Tales, printed nearly two centuries before Dr. Johnson was born.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-rainbow">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id195">THE RAINBOW.</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

<div class="line">Shipper's warning;</div>
<div class="line">Rainbow at night</div>
<div class="line">Shipper's delight.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This, in one form or other, is a most common weather proverb. The
present version was heard in Essex.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">If there be a rainbow in the eve,</div>
<div class="line">It will rain and leave;</div>
<div class="line">But if there be a rainbow in the morrow,</div>

<p>From Lancashire.</p>

<div class="line">When clouds appear like rocks and towers,</div>
<div class="line">The earth's refresh'd by frequent showers.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This proverb is sufficiently homely, yet the first line reminds us of
the description of the clouds in Anthony and Cleopatra, act iv. sc. 12;
but the commonest observer must have seen the &quot;tower'd citadel,&quot; and the
&quot;pendant rock.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A northern har</div>
<div class="line">Brings drought from far.</div>
</div>

<p>A har is a mist or thick fog.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">First comes David, next comes Chad,</div>
<div class="line">Then comes Whinwall as if he was mad.</div>
</div>

<p>Alluding to the storms about the day of St. Winwaloe, March 3d, called
St. Whinwall by the country people.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Rain, rain, go to Spain;</div>
<div class="line">Come again another day:</div>
<div class="line">When I brew and when I bake,</div>
<div class="line">I'll give you a figgy cake.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This appears to be a child's address to rain, a kind of charm or
entreaty for its disappearance. A plum-cake is always called a figgy
cake in Devonshire, where raisins are denominated <em>figs</em>, and hence the
term. Other versions are given by Chambers, p. 155, who remarks that it
was the practice among the children of Greece, when the sun happened to
be obscured by a cloud, to exclaim, Ἔξεχ' ὦ φίλ' ἥλιε—Come forth, beloved
sun! Howell, in his Proverbs, 1659, p. 20,
has,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Rain, rain, go to Spain;</div>
<div class="line">Fair weather, come again.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Little children have a custome, when it raines, to sing or charme away
the raine; they all joine in a chorus, and sing thus, viz.:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Raine, raine, goe away,</div>
<div class="line">Come againe a Saterday.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a conceit that this childish custome is of great antiquity, and
that it is derived from the gentiles.&quot; (Aubrey, MS. Lansd. 231.)</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">If Candlemas day be fair and bright,</div>
<div class="line">Winter will have another flight.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It is generally the case that fine weather continues if it is mild at
Candlemas. A somewhat similar proverb is given by M. Kuhn, Gebräuche und
Aberglauben, ii. 12.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">It is time to cock your hay and corn,</div>
<div class="line">When the old donkey blows his horn.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The braying of the ass is said to be an indication of rain or hail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="snow">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id197">SNOW.</a></h2>
<p>In Yorkshire, when it begins to snow, the boys exclaim,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Snow, snow faster,</div>
<div class="line">The cow's in the pasture.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>When the storm is concluding, or when they wish it to give over, they
sing,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Snow, snow, give over,</div>
<div class="line">The cow's in the clover!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>White</em> is the rural generic term for snow, and <em>black</em> for rain. Thus,
in the well-known proverb,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">February fill the dyke,</div>
<div class="line">Be it black or be it white;</div>
<div class="line">But if it be white,</div>
<div class="line">It's the better to like.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The Anglo-Saxon and Northern literatures are full of similar poetical
synonymes. A common nursery riddle conceals the term snow by the image
of a white glove, and another in the same manner designates rain as a
black glove:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Round the house, and round the house,</div>
<div class="line">And there lies a white glove in the window. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id81" id="id80">[38]</a></div>

<div class="section" id="the-moon">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id199">THE MOON.</a></h2>
<p>The inhabitants of most of our rural districts still retain the old
dislike to a new moon on Friday, and perpetuate it by the saying,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Friday's moon,</div>
<div class="line">Come when it wool,</div>
<div class="line">It comes too soon.</div>
</div>

<p>Or by the following,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Friday's moon,</div>
<div class="line">Once in seven year comes too soon.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Some persons, however, contend that Saturday is the unlucky day for the
new, and Sunday equally so for a full moon. So runs the distich,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Saturday's new, and Sunday's full,</div>
<div class="line">Was never fine, nor never wool.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The moon anciently occupied an important place in love-divinations. The
following invocation to the planet is used by young women throughout the
country:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">New moon, new moon, declare to me</div>
<div class="line">Shall I this night my true love see?</div>
<div class="line">Not in his best, but in the array</div>
<div class="line">As he walks in every day.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Or, sometimes, the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">New moon, new moon, I hail thee!</div>
<div class="line">By all the virtue in thy body,</div>
<div class="line">Grant this night that I may see</div>
<div class="line">He who my true love is to be.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Aubrey, in his Miscellanies, ed. 1696, p. 105, gives the following
lines, used in Yorkshire for charming the moon to cause a dream of a
future husband:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">All hail to the moon, all hail to thee!</div>
<div class="line">I, prithee, good moon, reveal to me</div>
<div class="line">This night who my husband must be!</div>

<div class="section" id="the-cuckoo">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id200">THE CUCKOO.</a></h2>
<p>We are usefully reminded of the season of the cuckoo by the following
homely proverbial lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In April,</div>
<div class="line">The cuckoo shows his bill;</div>
<div class="line">In May,</div>
<div class="line">He sings all day;</div>
<div class="line">In June,</div>
<div class="line">He alters his tune;</div>
<div class="line">In July,</div>
<div class="line">Away he'll fly;</div>
<div class="line">Come August,</div>
<div class="line">Away he must!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In some dialects thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In April,</div>
<div class="line">'A shake 'as bill;</div>
<div class="line">In May,</div>
<div class="line">'A pipe all day;</div>
<div class="line">In June,</div>
<div class="line">'A change 'as tune;</div>
<div class="line">In July,</div>
<div class="line">Away 'a fly;</div>
<div class="line">Else in August,</div>
<div class="line">Away 'a must.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the &quot;change of tune&quot; alluded to in these verses, it has been remarked
(Trans. Linn. Soc.) that in early season the cuckoo begins with the
interval of a minor third, proceeds to a major third, then to a fourth,
then to a fifth; after which his voice breaks, never attaining a minor
sixth. This was observed by old John Heywood, Workes, 1576, vi. 95:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In April the koo-coo can sing her note by rote,</div>
<div class="line">In June of tune she cannot sing a note;</div>
<div class="line">At first, koo-koo, koo-coo, sing shrill can she do;</div>
<div class="line">At last, kooke, kooke, kooke, six cookes to one koo.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following proverbial verses relating to this bird are current in the
North of England:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The cuckoo comes in April,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Stops all the month of May,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Sings a song at Midsummer,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And then he goes away.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">When the cuckoo comes to the bare thorn,</div>
<div class="line">Sell your cow and buy your corn;</div>
<div class="line">But when she comes to the full bit,</div>
<div class="line">Sell your corn and buy your sheep.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following &quot;tokens of love and marriage by hearing the cuckow, or
seeing other birds first in the morning,&quot; are extracted from an old
chap-book entitled, the Golden Cabinet, or the Compleat Fortune-teller,
n. d.: &quot;When you walk out in the spring, as soon as you hear the cuckow,
sit down on a bank or other convenient place, and pull your stockings
off, saying,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">May this to me,</div>
<div class="line">Now happy be.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Then look between your great toe and the next, you'll find a hair that
will easily come off. Take and look at it, and of the same colour will
that of your lover be; wrap it in a piece of paper, and keep it ten days
carefully; then, if it has not changed, the person will be constant: but
if it dies, you are flattered.&quot; Gay alludes to this method of divination
in his Fourth Pastoral, ed. 1742, p. 32.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-robin-and-the-wren">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id201">THE ROBIN AND THE WREN.</a></h2>
<p>The superstitious reverence with which these birds are almost
universally regarded takes its origin from a pretty belief that they
undertake the delicate office of covering the dead bodies of any of the
human race with moss or leaves, if by any means left exposed to the
heavens. This opinion is alluded to by Shakespeare and many writers of
his time, as by Drayton, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Cov'ring with moss the dead's unclosed eye,</div>
<div class="line">The little red-breast teacheth charitie.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Webster, in his tragedy of Vittoria Corombona, 1612, couples the wren
with the robin as coadjutors in this friendly office:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Call for the robin red-breast and the wren,</div>
<div class="line">Since o'er shady groves they hover,</div>
<div class="line">And with leaves and flowers do cover</div>
<div class="line">The friendless bodies of unburied men.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Notwithstanding the beautiful passage in Shakespeare to which we have
alluded, it is nevertheless undeniable that, even to this day, the
ancient belief attached to these birds is perpetuated chiefly by the
simple ballad of the Babes in the Wood. Early in the last century,
Addison was infatuated with that primitive song. &quot;Admitting,&quot; he says,
&quot;there is even a despicable simplicity in the verse, yet because the
sentiments appear genuine and unaffected, they are able to move the
mind of the most polite reader with inward meltings of humanity and
compassion.&quot; Exactly so; but this result arises from the extraordinary
influence of early association over the mind, not from the pathos of the
ballad itself, which is infinitely inferior to the following beautiful
little nursery song I have the pleasure of transcribing into these
pages:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">My dear, do you know</div>
<div class="line">How a long time ago,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Two poor little children,</div>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And left in a wood,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">As I've heard people say.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">And when it was night,</div>
<div class="line">So sad was their plight,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The sun it went down,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And the moon gave no light!</div>
<div class="line">They sobb'd and they sigh'd,</div>
<div class="line">And they bitterly cried,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And the poor little things,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">They laid down and died.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">And when they were dead,</div>
<div class="line">The robins so red</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Brought strawberry leaves,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And over them spread;</div>
<div class="line">And all the day long,</div>
<div class="line">They sang them this song,—</div>
<div class="line">Poor babes in the wood!</div>
<div class="line">Poor babes in the wood!</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And don't you remember</div>
</div>

<p>Adages respecting the robin and the wren, generally including the martin
and swallow, are common in all parts of the country. In giving the

paramour of the tom-tit!</p>

of no irreverence. On the contrary, the sanctification of these harmless
birds is no unpoetical or objectionable fragment of the old popular
mythology; and when we reflect that not even a sparrow &quot;is forgotten
before God,&quot; can we blame a persuasion which protects more innocent
members of the feathered tribes from the intrusion of the wanton
destroyer?</p>
<p>It is exceedingly unlucky to molest the nests of any of these birds.
This belief is very prevalent, and it was acted upon in a case which
came under my observation, where, misfortune having twice followed the
destruction of a swallow's nest, the birds were afterwards freely
permitted to enjoy the corner of a portico, where their works were
certainly not very ornamental. The following verses were obtained from
Essex:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The robin and the red-breast,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The robin and the wren;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">If ye take out o' their nest,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Ye'll never thrive agen!</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">The robin and the red-breast,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The martin and the swallow;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">If ye touch one o' their eggs,</div>

<p>The Irish call the wren the king of birds; and they have a story that,
when the birds wanted to choose a king, they determined that the one
which could fly highest should have the crown. The wren, being small,
very cunningly hid itself under the wing of the eagle; and when that
bird could fly no higher, the wren slipped from its hiding-place, and
easily gained the victory. In Cotgrave's Dictionarie, 1632, we find the
wren called <em>roitelet</em>, and in another dictionary, quoted by Mr. Wright,
it is called <em>roi des oiseaux</em>, so it is probable a similar superstition
prevailed in France. The ceremony of hunting of the wren on St.
Stephen's day has been so frequently described, that it is not necessary
to do more than allude to it, and to mention that Mr. Crofton Croker
possesses a proclamation lately issued by the mayor of Cork, forbidding
the custom, with the intent &quot;to prevent cruelty to animals,&quot; as the
document is headed. This custom was also prevalent in France. An
analogous ceremony is still observed in Pembrokeshire on Twelfth-day,
where it is customary to carry about a wren, termed <em>the king</em>, inclosed
in a box with glass windows, surmounted by a wheel, from which are
appended various coloured ribands. It is attended by men and boys, who
visit the farm-houses, and sing a song, the following fragments of which
are all that have come under my observation:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For we are come here</div>
<div class="line">To taste your good cheer,</div>
<div class="line">And the king is well dressed</div>
<div class="line">In silks of the best.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">He is from a cottager's stall,</div>
<div class="line">To a fine gilded hall.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The poor bird often dies under the ceremony, which tradition connects
with the death of an ancient British king at the time of the Saxon
invasion. The rhyme used in Ireland runs thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The wren, the wren, the king of all birds,</div>
<div class="line">Was caught St. Stephen's day in the furze;</div>
<div class="line">Although he's little his family's great,</div>
<div class="line">Then pray, gentlefolks, give him a treat.</div>

<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Once I was a monarch's daughter,</div>

</blockquote>
<p>An anonymous writer, in the Gentleman's Magazine, vol. lxxiv. p. 1003,
mentions an old fairy tale respecting the owl, which, he says, is well
known to the nurses of Herefordshire. A certain fairy, disguised as an
old distressed woman, went to a baker's shop, and begged some dough of
his daughter, of whom she obtained a very small piece. This she farther
requested leave to bake in the oven, where it swelling to the size of a
large loaf, the baker's daughter refused to let her have it. She,
however, gave the pretended beggar another piece of dough, but still
smaller than the first; this swelled in the oven even more than the
other, and was in like manner retained. A third and still smaller piece
of dough came out of the oven the largest of all, and shared the same
fate. The disguised fairy, convinced of the woman's covetousness by
these repeated experiments, no longer restrained her indignation. She
resumed her proper form, and struck the culprit with her wand, who
immediately flew out of the window in the shape of an owl. This story
may be a version of the legend alluded to by Ophelia in Hamlet, iv. 5:
&quot;They say the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but
know not what we may be.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="magpies">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id203">MAGPIES.</a></h2>
<p>Wide-spread is the superstition that it is unlucky to see magpies under
certain conditions, but these vary considerably in different localities.
Thus, in some counties, two bring sorrow, in others joy; while, in some
places, we are instructed that one magpie is a signal of misfortune,
which can, however, be obviated by pulling off your hat, and making a
very polite bow to the knowing bird. This operation I have more than
once seen quite seriously performed. In Lancashire they say:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">One for anger,</div>
<div class="line">Two for mirth,</div>
<div class="line">Three for a wedding,</div>
<div class="line">Four for a birth,</div>
<div class="line">Five for rich,</div>
<div class="line">Six for poor,</div>
<div class="line">Seven for a witch,</div>
<div class="line">I can tell you no more.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>But in Tim Bobbin it is expressly said that two are indicative of ill
fortune: &quot;I saigh two rott'n pynots, hongum, that wur a sign o' bad
fashin; for I heard my gronny say hoode os leef o seen two owd harries
os two pynots.&quot; The same belief obtains in Scotland. In the North they
thus address the bird:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Magpie, magpie, chatter and flee,</div>
<div class="line">Turn up thy tail, and good luck fall me.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The half-nest of the magpie is accounted for by a rural ornithological
legend. Once on a time, when the world was very young, the magpie, by
some accident or another, although she was quite as cunning as she is at
present, was the only bird that was unable to build a nest. In this
perplexity, she applied to the other members of the feathered race, who
kindly undertook to instruct her. So, on a day appointed, they assembled
for that purpose, and, the materials having been collected, the
blackbird said, &quot;Place that stick there,&quot; suiting the action to the
word, as she commenced the work. &quot;Ah!&quot; said the magpie, &quot;I knew that
afore.&quot; The other birds followed with their suggestions, but to every
piece of advice, the magpie kept saying, &quot;Ah! I knew that afore.&quot; At
length, when the birdal habitation was half-finished, the patience of
the company was fairly exhausted by the pertinacious conceit of the pye,
so they all left her with the united exclamation, &quot;Well, Mistress Mag,
as you seem to know all about it, you may e'en finish the nest
yourself.&quot; Their resolution was obdurate and final, and to this day the
magpie exhibits the effects of partial instruction by her miserably
incomplete abode.</p>
<p>The magpie is always called Madge, and the Christian names given to
birds deserve a notice. Thus we have Jack Snipe, Jenny Wren, Jack Daw,
Tom Tit, Robin Redbreast, Poll Parrot, Jill Hooter, Jack Curlew, Jack
Nicker, and King Harry for the goldfinch, and the list might be widely
extended. A starling is always Jacob, a sparrow is Philip, a raven is
Ralph, and the consort of the Tom Tit rejoices in the euphonic name of
Betty! Children give the name of Dick to all small birds, which, in
nursery parlance, are universally Dickybirds.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id208">THE WOOD-PIGEON.</a></h2>
<p>An Isle of Wight legend respecting this bird tells us that, soon after
the creation of the world, all the birds were assembled for the purpose
of learning to build their nests, and the magpie, being very sagacious
and cunning, was chosen to teach them. Those birds that were most
industrious, such as the wren and the long-tailed-capon, or pie-finch,
he instructed to make whole nests in the shape of a cocoa-nut, with a
small hole on one side; others, not so diligent, he taught to make
half-nests, shaped something like a teacup. Having thus instructed a
great variety of birds according to their capacity, it came to the turn
of the wood-pigeon, who, being a careless and lazy bird, was very
indifferent about the matter, and while the magpie was directing him how
to place the little twigs, &amp;c., he kept exclaiming, &quot;What, athurt and
across! what zoo! what zoo!—athurt and across! what zoo! what zoo!&quot; At
length the magpie was so irritated with his stupidity and indolence,
that he flew away, and the wood-pigeon, having had no more instruction,
to this day builds the worst nest of any of the feathered tribe,
consisting merely of layers of cross-twigs.</p>
<p>Montagu gives a Suffolk version of the tale, which differs considerably
from the above. &quot;The magpie, it is said, once undertook to teach the
pigeon how to build a more substantial and commodious dwelling; but,
instead of being a docile pupil, the pigeon kept on her old cry of 'Take
two, Taffy! take two!' The magpie insisted that this was a very
unworkmanlike manner of proceeding, one stick at a time being as much as
could be managed to advantage; but the pigeon reiterated her 'two, take
two,' till Mag, in a violent passion, gave up the task, exclaiming, 'I
say that one at a time's enough; and, if you think otherwise, you may
set about the work yourself, for I will have no more to do with it!'
Since that time, the wood-pigeon has built her slight platform of
sticks, which certainly suffers much in comparison with the strong
substantial structure of the magpie.&quot; The cooing of the wood-pigeon
produces, it is said—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Take two-o coo, Taffy!</div>
<div class="line">Take two-o coo, Taffy!</div>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id209">DOMESTIC POULTRY.</a></h2>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id210">DRAGON-FLIES.</a></h2>
<p>In some parts of the Isle of Wight, these insects are found of a
peculiarly large size, and their colours are extremely beautiful. There
is an old legend respecting them which is still current. It is supposed
by the country people that their sting or bite is venomous, as bad as
that of a snake or adder, and perhaps from this belief their provincial
name of snake-stanger or snake-stang is derived. It is said that these
insects can distinguish the good children from the bad when they go
fishing: if the latter go too near the water, they are almost sure to be
bitten; but when the good boys go, the dragon-flies point out the places
where the fish are, by settling on the banks, or flags, in the proper
direction. This curious myth is commemorated by the following song:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Snakestanger! snakestanger! vlee aal about the brooks;</div>

lines. &quot;In England,&quot; he says, &quot;the snail scoops out hollows, little
rotund chambers, in limestone, for its residence. This habit of the
animal is so important in its effects, as to have attracted the
attention of geologists; one of the most distinguished of whom (Dr.
Buckland) alluded to it at the meeting of the British Association at
Plymouth, in 1841.&quot; The above rhyme is a boy's invocation to the snail
to come out of such holes or any other places of retreat resorted to by
it. Mr. Chambers also informs us that, in some districts of Scotland, it
is supposed that it is an indication of good weather if the snail obeys
the injunction of putting out its horn:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Snailie, snailie, shoot out your horn,</div>
<div class="line">And tell us if it will be a bonnie day the morn.</div>

<p>It appears from Gay's Shepherd's Week, ed. 1742, p. 34, that snails were
formerly used in rural love-divinations. It was the custom <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id93" id="id92">[44]</a> to place
the little animal on the soft ashes, and to form an opinion respecting
the initial of the name of a future lover by the fancied letter made by
the crawling of the snail on the ashes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Last May-day fair I search'd to find a snail,</div>
<div class="line">That might my secret lover's name reveal;</div>
<div class="line">Upon a gooseberry bush a snail I found,</div>
<div class="line">For always snails near sweetest fruit abound.</div>
<div class="line">I seiz'd the vermin, home I quickly sped,</div>
<div class="line">And on the hearth the milk-white embers spread.</div>
<div class="line">Slow crawl'd the snail, and if I right can spell,</div>
<div class="line">In the soft ashes mark'd a curious L;</div>
<div class="line">Oh, may this wondrous omen lucky prove,</div>

<p>Verses on the snail, similar to those given above, are current over many
parts of Europe. In Denmark, the children say (Thiele, iii. 138)—</p>

<p>There is a common persuasion amongst country people that whipping a

<p>Ash, when green, makes good fire-wood, and, contrary perhaps to all
other sorts of wood, is bad for that purpose when <em>sear</em>, or dry,
withered. The old Anglo-Saxon term <em>sear</em> is well illustrated by this
homely proverb. The reader will remember Macbeth:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Tobacco was formerly held in great esteem as a medicine. Sickness was
the old term for illness of any kind, and is no doubt the more correct
expression.</p>
<p>It may just be worth a passing notice to observe, that Shakespeare never
mentions <em>tobacco</em>, nor alludes to it even indirectly. What a brilliant
subject for a critic! A treatise might be written to prove from this
circumstance that the great poet was not in the habit of smoking; or, on
the contrary, that he was so great an admirer of the pernicious weed,
that, being unable to allude to it without a panegyric, he very wisely
eschewed the subject for fear of giving offence to his royal master, the
author of the 'Counterblast.' The discussion, at all events, would be
productive of as much utility as the disputes which have occasioned so
many learned letters respecting the orthography of the poet's name.</p>

<p>Metrical proverbs are so numerous, that a large volume might be filled
with them without much difficulty; and it is, therefore, unnecessary to
say that nothing beyond a very small selection is here attempted. We may
refer the curious reader to the collections of Howell, Ray, and Denham,
the last of which chiefly relates to natural objects and the weather,
for other examples; but the subject is so diffuse, that these writers
have gone a very short way towards the compilation of a complete series.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Give a thing and take again,</div>
<div class="line">And you shall ride in hell's wain!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p id="erratum">Said by children when one wishes a gift to be returned, a system
naturally much disliked. So says Plato, των ορθως δοθεντων
αφαιρεσις ουκ εστι. Ray, p. 113, ed. 1768. Ben Jonson appears to allude
to this proverb in the Sad Shepherd, where Maudlin says—&quot;Do you give a
thing and take a thing, madam?&quot; Cotgrave, Dictionarie of the French and
English Tongues, 1632, in v. <em>Retirer</em>, mentions &quot;a triviall proverb:&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Give a thing,</div>
<div class="line">And take a thing,</div>
<div class="line">To weare the divell's gold-ring.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And it is alluded to in a little work entitled Homer à la Mode, a mock
poem upon the First and Second Books of Homer's Iliads, 12mo. Oxford,
1665, p. 34:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Prethee for my sake let him have her,</div>
<div class="line">Because to him the Græcians gave her;</div>
<div class="line">To give a thing, and take a thing,</div>
<div class="line">You know is the devil's gold-ring!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The proverb sometimes runs thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Give a thing, take a thing,</div>
<div class="line">That's an old man's play-thing.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;A lee with a hatchet,&quot; as they say in the North, is a circumstantial
self-evident falsehood, and so runs the proverb:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">That's a lie with a latchet,</div>
<div class="line">All the dogs in the town cannot match it.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Children say the following when one has been detected in any
misrepresentation of a mischievous character—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Liar, liar, lick spit,</div>
<div class="line">Your tongue shall be slit,</div>
<div class="line">And all the dogs in the town</div>
<div class="line">Shall have a little bit.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following versions of the former rhyme are current in the North of
England:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">That's a lee wi' a latchet,</div>
<div class="line">You may shut the door and catch it.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">That's a lee wi' a lid on,</div>
<div class="line">And a brass handle to tak houd on.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In Yorkshire a tell-tale is termed a <em>pleen-pie</em>, and there is a
proverb current which is very similar to that given above:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A pleen-pie tit,</div>
<div class="line">Thy tongue sal be slit,</div>
<div class="line">An iv'ry dog i' th' town</div>
<div class="line">Sal hev a bit.</div>

<div class="line">Left and right</div>
<div class="line">Brings good at night.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>When your right eye itches, it is a sign of good luck; when the left, a
sign of bad luck. When both itch, the above distich expresses the
popular belief.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">He got out of the muxy,</div>
<div class="line">And fell into the pucksy.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>A muxy is a dunghill, and the pucksy a quagmire. This is a variation of
the old saying of falling out of the dripping-pan into the fire:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare Charybdini.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Those that made me were uncivil,</div>
<div class="line">For they made me harder than the devil!</div>
<div class="line">Knives won't cut me, fire won't sweat me,</div>
<div class="line">Dogs bark at me, but can't eat me!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>These proverbial lines are supposed to be spoken by Suffolk cheese,
which is so hard that a myth tells us gate-pegs in that county are made
with it. The proverb has been long true, and Pepys, writing in 1661,
says: &quot;I found my wife vexed at her people for grumbling to eate Suffolk
cheese, which I also am vexed at.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="section" id="tit-for-tat">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id223">TIT FOR TAT.</a></h2>
<p>The proverb of <em>tit for tat</em> may perhaps be said to be going out of
fashion, but it is still a universal favorite with children. When any
one is ill-natured, and the sufferer wishes to hint his intention of
retaliating at the first convenient opportunity, he cries out—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Tit for tat,</div>

</blockquote>
<p>This distich is said by a boy who feels very lazy, yet wishes to exert
himself. Lazy Lawrence is a proverbial expression for an idle person,
and I possess an old chapbook, entitled &quot;the History of Lawrence Lazy,
containing his birth and slothful breeding; how he served the
schoolmaster, his wife, the squire's cook, and the farmer, which, by the
laws of Lubberland, was accounted high treason.&quot; A West country proverb,
relating to a disciple of this hero, runs thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Sluggardy guise,</div>
<div class="line">Loth to go to bed,</div>
<div class="line">And loth to rise.</div>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id228">THE CAULD LAD OF HILTON.</a></h2>
<p>This fairy or goblin was seldom seen, but his gambols were heard nightly
in the hall of the great house. He overturned everything in the kitchen
after the servants had gone to bed, and was, in short, one of the most
mischievous sprites you could imagine. One night, however, the kitchen
happened to be left in great confusion, and the goblin, who did
everything by contraries, set it completely to rights; and the next
morning it was in perfect apple-pie order. We may be quite sure that,
after this occurrence, the kitchen was not again made orderly by the
servants.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, however, the service thus nightly rendered by the Cauld
Lad, the servants did not like it. They preferred to do their own work
without preternatural agency, and accordingly resolved to do their best
to drive him from their haunts. The goblin soon understood what was
going on, and he was heard in the dead of night to warble the following
lines in a melancholy strain:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Wae's me! wae's me!</div>
<div class="line">The acorn is not yet</div>
<div class="line">Fallen from the tree,</div>
<div class="line">That's to grow the wood,</div>
<div class="line">That's to make the cradle,</div>
<div class="line">That's to rock the bairn,</div>
<div class="line">That's to grow to a man,</div>
<div class="line">That's to lay me.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>He was, however, deceived in this prediction; for one night, being
colder than usual, he complained in moving verse of his condition.
Accordingly, on the following evening, a cloak and hood were placed for
him near the fire. The servants had unconsciously accomplished their
deliverance, for present gifts to fairies, and they for ever disappear.
On the next morning the following lines were found inscribed on the
wall:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I've taken your cloak, I've taken your hood;</div>
<div class="line">The Cauld Lad of Hilton will do no more good!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>A great variety of stories in which fairies are frightened away by
presents, are still to be heard in the rural districts of England.
Another narrative, by Mr. Longstaffe, relates that on one occasion a
woman found her washing and ironing regularly performed for her every
night by the fairies. In gratitude to the &quot;good people,&quot; she placed
green mantles for their acceptance, and the next night the fairies
departed, exclaiming—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Now the pixies' work is done!</div>
<div class="line">We take our clothes, and off we run.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Bray tells a similar story of a Devonshire pixy, who helped an old
woman to spin. One evening she spied the fairy jumping out of her door,
and observed that it was very raggedly dressed; so the next day she
thought to win the services of the elf further by placing some smart new
clothes, as big as those made for a doll, by the side of her wheel. The
pixy came, put on the clothes, and clapping its hands with delight,
vanished, saying these lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Pixy fine, pixy gay,</div>
<div class="line">Pixy now will run away.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Fairies always talk in rhyme. Mr. Allies mentions a Worcestershire fairy
legend which says that, upon one occasion, a pixy came to a ploughman in
a field, and exclaimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Oh, lend a hammer and a nail,</div>
<div class="line">Which we want to mend our pail.</div>

<p>This rhyme is traditionally known in the North of England, and refers,
it is said, to Sir Ralph Ashton, who, in the latter part of the
fifteenth century, exercised great severity as vice-constable. The
ancient custom of <em>riding the black lad</em> at Ashton-under-Lyne on Easter
Monday, which consists of carrying an effigy on horseback through the
town, shooting at it, and finally burning it, is alleged to have taken
its origin from this individual, who, according to tradition, was shot
as he was riding down the principal street. According to another story,
the custom commemorates the valiant actions of Thomas Ashton at the
battle of Neville's Cross.</p>

According to the ballads on the subject, the spirit of the boy answers

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id237">ROLLRIGHT.</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;Druidical&quot; stones at Rollright, Oxfordshire, are said to have been
originally a general and his army who were transformed into stones by a
magician. The tradition runs that there was a prophecy or oracle which
told the general,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">If Long Compton thou canst see,</div>
<div class="line">King of England thou shalt be.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>He was within a few yards of the spot whence that town could be
observed, when his progress was stopped by the magician's
transformation,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Sink down man, and rise up stone!</div>
<div class="line">King of England thou shalt be none.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The general was transformed into a large stone which stands on a spot
from which Long Compton is not visible, but on ascending a slight rise
close to it, the town is revealed to view. Roger Gale, writing in 1719,
says that whoever dared to contradict this story was regarded &quot;as a most
audacious freethinker.&quot; It is said that no man could ever count these
stones, and that a baker once attempted it by placing a penny loaf on
each of them, but somehow or other he failed in counting his own bread.

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id252">SHERSTON MAGNA.</a></h2>
<p>The following very curious observations on this town are extracted from
an anonymous MS. in my possession, written forty or fifty years ago. I
have never seen the lines in print. Aubrey, in his Natural History of
Wiltshire, mentions the plant called <em>Danes-blood</em>, and derives the
name from a similar circumstance. Some observations on Sherston may be
seen in Camden, ed. Gough, i. 96. It is Sceor-stán, where the celebrated
battle between the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes was fought in the year
1016, and prodigies of valour exhibited by the combatants.</p>
<p>&quot;When a schoolboy, I have often traced the intrenchments at Sherston
Magna, which are still visible on the north side of the town, and
particularly in a field near the brow of a hill which overlooks a branch
of the river Avon, which rises a little below Didmarton; and with other
boys have gone in quest of a certain plant in the field where the battle
was said to have been fought, which the inhabitants pretended dropt
blood when gathered, and called Danesblood, corruptly no doubt for
<em>Danewort</em>, which was supposed to have sprung from the blood of the
Danes slain in that battle. Among other memorials, the statue of a brave
warrior, vulgarly called Rattlebone, but whose real name I could never
learn, is still standing upon a pedestal on the east side of the
church-porch, as I've been lately informed, where I saw it above fifty
years ago: of whose bravery, almost equal to that of Withrington, many
fabulous stories are told. One, in particular, like some of the Grecian
fables of old, built upon the resemblance his shield bears to the shape
of a tile-stone, which he is said to have placed over his stomach after
it had been ripped up in battle, and by that means maintained the field;
whilst the following rude verses are said to have been repeated by the
king by way of encouragement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Fight on, Rattlebone,</div>
<div class="line">And thou shalt have Sherstone;</div>
<div class="line">If Sherstone will not do,</div>
<div class="line">Then Easton Grey and Pinkney too.&quot;</div>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Johnny tuth' Bellas daft was thy poll,</div>
<div class="line">When thou changed Bellas for Henknoll.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This saying, as given by Surtees, is still remembered near Bellasis, and
is preferable to Hutchinson's version of it from the east window of the
north transept of St. Andrew's Auckland church, where he says, &quot;are
remains of an inscription painted on the glass; the date appears 1386;
beneath the inscription are the arms of Bellasys, and in a belt round
them the following words:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Bellysys Belysys dafe was thy sowel,</div>
<div class="line">When exchanged Belysys for Henknowell.&quot;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Collins (followed by Hutchinson), who gives the proverb as—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Belasise, Belassis, daft was thy nowle,</div>
<div class="line">When thou gave Bellassis for Henknowle,</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>connects it with a grant dated 1380, from John de Belasye to the convent
of Durham, of his lands in Wolveston, in exchange for the Manor of
Henknoll. But Bellasyse is not even within the Manor of Wolveston, and,
in fact, the Manor of Bellasye was held by the Prior in 1361; and we can
only account for the proverb by supposing that, at a former period,
Bellasyse had been exchanged for lands, but not the manor of Henknoll.
The legend dates the matter in crusading times, and is chivalric in the
extreme. John of Bellasis minded to take up the cross, and fight in
Holy Land, found his piety sorely let and hindered by his attachment to
the green pastures and deep meadows of his ancestors. With resolution
strong, he exchanged them with the Church of Durham, for Henknoll, near
Auckland. He went to fight, but lived it seems to return and repent his
rash bargain. I descend by one step, from the sublime to the ridiculous,
to mention how oddly more recent characters are wound round those of
olden time, for a popular notion is that the Red-Cross Knight had
enormous teeth, and was passionately addicted to &quot;race-horses!&quot;
Children, moreover, have a dark saying when they leap off anything:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Bellasay, Bellasay, what time of day?</div>
<div class="line">One o'clock, two o'clock, three and away!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Bellasyse, the heiress of Brancepeth, died for love of Robert
Shafto, of Whitworth, whose portrait at Whitworth represents him as very
young and handsome, with <em>yellow</em> hair. He was the favorite candidate in
the election of 1791, when he was popularly called Bonny Bobby Shafto;
and the old song of the older Bobby, who, it seems, was also &quot;bright and
fair, combing down his <em>yellow</em> hair,&quot; was revived with the addition
of—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Bobby Shafto's looking out,</div>
<div class="line">All his ribbons flew about,</div>
<div class="line">All the ladies gave a shout—</div>
<div class="line">Hey, for Bobby Shafto!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The most ancient verses of the old song seem to be—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Bobby Shafto's gone to sea,</div>
<div class="line">Silver buckles at his knee;</div>
<div class="line">He'll come back and marry me,</div>

<p>&quot;As for the town, though it flourished mightily for some years together
after the Norman Conquest, by reason of a staple for wooll and other
commodities, setled here by King Edward the Third; yet it met still with
some calamities or other, which hindred its growth and eclipsed its
grandeur, for it had its share of sufferings, both by fire and water, in
King Stephen's days, about which time, it seems, though the king had at
first been conquered and taken prisoner, yet he afterward entred into
the city in triumph, with his crown upon his head, to break the citizens
of a superstitious opinion they held, that no king could possibly enter
into that city after such a manner, but some great disaster or other
would befal him; but neither did it then, or by the barons' wars
afterwards, sustain half the damages which of late years it hath
received from the devouring hands of time, who hath wrought its downfal,
and from a rich and populous city hath reduced it almost to the lowest
ebb of fortune; and of fifty churches, which were all standing within

<p>After the abdication of James the Second, in the year 1688, a rumour was
spread in the North of England that he was lying off the Yorkshire
coast, ready to make a descent with a numerous army from France, in
hopes of regaining his lost throne. This report gave the Lord Lieutenant
of Westmoreland an opportunity of showing his own and the people's
attachment to the new order of things; he accordingly called out the
<em>posse comitatus</em>, comprising all able-bodied men from sixteen to sixty.
The order was obeyed with alacrity; and the inhabitants met armed in a
field called Miller's-close, near Kendal, from whence they marched to
Kirby Lonsdale. This historical fact explains the above popular rhyme,

<p>Although the spread of education has doubtlessly weakened in an
extraordinary degree the hold which superstition formerly maintained on
the mind of the public, yet vestiges of the more innocent portions of
superstitious belief are still in considerable repute amongst the lower
orders, and may be found in all their force in many of the rural

would benefit the cause of religion and morality, treason though it be
in these times to doubt the efficacy of argumentative education. But all
of us cannot be philosophers; and need we reprove a pretty village
maiden for plucking the even-ash or four-leaved clover? The selfish

maid, and also in her mother's young time, that if it happened their
butter would not come readily, they used a charm to be said over it
whilst yet it was in beating, and it would come straightways, and that
was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Come, butter, come,</div>
<div class="line">Come, butter, come;</div>
<div class="line">Peter stands at the gate,</div>
<div class="line">Waiting for a buttered cake;</div>
<div class="line">Come, butter, come!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This, said the old woman, being said three times, will make your butter
come, for it was taught my mother by a learned churchman in Queen
Marie's days; whenas churchmen had more cunning, and could teach people
many a trick that our ministers now-a-days know not.&quot;—Ady's Candle in
the Dark, 1656, p. 59.</p>
<p>&quot;There be twenty several ways,&quot; says Scot, 1584, &quot;to make your butter
come, which for brevity I omit, as to bind your churn with a rope, to
thrust therein a red-hot spit, &amp;c.; but your best remedy and surest way
is to look well to your dairy-maid or wife, that she neither eat up the
cream, nor sell away your butter.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Effusion of Blood.</em>—From Worcestershire.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Jesus was born in Bethlehem,</div>
<div class="line">Baptized in the river Jordan;</div>
<div class="line">The water was wild and wood,</div>
<div class="line">But he was just and good;</div>
<div class="line">God spake, and the water stood,</div>
<div class="line">And so shall now thy blood.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Charms were formerly always used when wounds were attempted to be cured.
So in the old ballad of Tommy Potts:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Tom Potts was but a serving-man,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But yet he was a doctor good;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">He bound his handkerchief on the wound,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And with some words he staunched the blood.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Bed-charm.</em>—The following is one of the most common rural charms that
are in vogue. Boys are taught to repeat it instead of a prayer:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,</div>
<div class="line">Bless the bed that I lay on;</div>
<div class="line">Four corners to my bed,</div>
<div class="line">Four angels round my head,</div>
<div class="line">One at head and one at feet,</div>
<div class="line">And two to keep my soul asleep!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many variations of it. Ady, in his Candle in the Dark, 1656,
p. 58, gives the first two lines as having been used by an old woman in
the time of Queen Mary.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,</div>
<div class="line">Bless the bed that I lie on!</div>
<div class="line">All the four corners round about,</div>
<div class="line">When I get in, when I get out!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The two following distiches were obtained from Lancashire, but I cannot
profess to explain them, unless indeed they were written by the Puritans
to ridicule the above:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,</div>
<div class="line">Hold the horse that I leap on!</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,</div>
<div class="line">Take a stick and lay upon!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Burn.</em>—The following charm, repeated three times, was used by an old
woman in Sussex, within the last forty years:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Two angels from the North,</div>
<div class="line">One brought fire, the other brought frost:</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Out fire!</div>
<div class="line">In frost!</div>
</div>
<div class="line">In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Pepys has recorded this, with a slight variation, in his Diary, vol. ii.
p. 416.</p>
<p><em>Thorn.</em>—This rural charm for a thorn was obtained from Yorkshire:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Unto the Virgin Mary our Saviour was born,</div>
<div class="line">And on his head he wore a crown of thorn;</div>
<div class="line">If you believe this true and mind it well,</div>
<div class="line">This hurt will never fester nor swell!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following one is given by Lord Northampton in his Defensative
against the Poyson of supposed Prophecies, 1583, as having been used by
Mother Joane of Stowe:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Our Lord was the fyrst man</div>
<div class="line">That ever thorne prickt upon;</div>
<div class="line">It never blysted, nor it never belted,</div>
<div class="line">And I pray God nor this not may.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And Pepys, ii. 415, gives another:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Christ was of a virgin born,</div>
<div class="line">And he was pricked with a thorn;</div>
<div class="line">And it did neither bell nor swell,</div>
<div class="line">And I trust in Jesus this never will.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Toothache.</em>—A very common one in the North of England, but I do not
remember to have seen it in print.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Peter was sitting on a marble-stone,</div>
<div class="line">And Jesus passed by;</div>
<div class="line">Peter said, &quot;my Lord, my God,</div>

You must anoint the backbone, or wear it on your breast. This is printed
in Mr. W. Lilly's Astrology. Mr. H. C. hath try'd this receipt with good

<p><em>Sciatica.</em>—The patient must lie on his back on the bank of a river or
brook of water, with a straight staff by his side between him and the
water, and must have the following words repeated over him—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Bone-shave right,</div>

<p>The <em>bone-shave</em> is a Devonshire term for the sciatica. See the Exmoor
Scolding, ed. 1839, p. 2.</p>

<p>This charm continued in use long after the publication of Scot's work. A
version of it, slightly altered, is given in the Athenian Oracle, 1728,
i. 158, as having been used by a country empyryc.</p>
<p><em>Evil Spirits.</em>—&quot;When I was a boy,&quot; says Aubrey, MS. Lansd. 231, &quot;a

<p>These curious lines are said by Devonshire children when they go through

Goodfellow as a method of asking permission to trace them. Biddy bene,
A.-S. <em>biddan</em>, to ask or pray, <em>bén</em>, a supplication or entreaty.
Buckee, possibly a corruption of Puck.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-ox">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id266">THE OX.</a></h2>
<p>In Herefordshire, on the eve of Twelfth-day, the best ox, white or
spotted, has a cake placed on his left horn; the men and girls of the
farm-house being present, drink out of a silver tankard to him,
repeating this verse—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">We drink to thee and thy white horn,</div>
<div class="line">Pray God send master a good crop of corn,</div>
<div class="line">Wheat, rye, and barley, and all sorts of grain:</div>
<div class="line">If alive at the next time, I'll hail thee again!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The animal is then sprinkled with the libation. This makes him toss his
head up and down, and if, in so doing, the cake be thrown forwards, it
is a good omen; if backwards, the contrary. Sir S. Meyrick, Trans.
Brit. Arch. Assoc. Glouc. 1848, p. 128, appears to consider this custom
a relic of the ancient Pagan religion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="love-divinations">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id267">LOVE DIVINATIONS.</a></h2>
<p><em>Butter-dock.</em>—The seeds of butterdock must be sowed by a young
unmarried woman half an hour before sunrise on a Friday morning, in a
lonesome place. She must strew the seeds gradually on the grass, saying
these words—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I sow, I sow!</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Then, my own dear,</div>
<div class="line">Come here, come here,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And mow and mow!</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The seed being scattered, she will see her future husband mowing with a
scythe at a short distance from her. She must not be frightened, for, if
she says &quot;Have mercy on me,&quot; he will immediately vanish. This method is
said to be infallible, but it is looked upon as a bold, desperate, and
presumptuous undertaking.</p>
<p><em>True-love.</em>—Two young unmarried girls must sit together in a room by
themselves, from twelve o'clock at night till one o'clock the next
morning, without speaking a word. During this time each of them must
take as many hairs from her head as she is years old, and, having put
them into a linen cloth with some of the herb true-love, as soon as the
clock strikes one, she must burn every hair separately, saying—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I offer this my sacrifice</div>
<div class="line">To him most precious in my eyes;</div>
<div class="line">I charge thee now come forth to me,</div>
<div class="line">That I this minute may thee see.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon which her first husband will appear, and walk round the room, and
then vanish. The same event happens to both the girls, but neither see
the other's lover.</p>
<p>Gerard says of the herb true-love or moonwort, p. 328, that &quot;witches do
wonders withall, who say that it will loose locks, and make them to fall
from the feete of horses that grase where it doth growe.&quot;</p>
<p>A charm-divination on the 6th of October, St. Faith's day, is still in
use in the North of England. A cake of flour, spring water, salt and
sugar, is made by three girls, each having an equal hand in the
composition. It is then baked in a Dutch oven, silence being strictly
preserved, and turned thrice by each person. When it is well baked, it
must be divided into three equal parts, and each girl must cut her share
into nine pieces, drawing every piece through a wedding-ring which had
been borrowed from a woman who has been married seven years. Each girl
must eat her pieces of cake while she is undressing, and repeat the
following verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">O good St. Faith, be kind to-night,</div>
<div class="line">And bring to me my heart's delight;</div>
<div class="line">Let me my future husband view,</div>
<div class="line">And be my visions chaste and true.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>All three must then get into one bed, with the ring suspended by a
string to the head of the couch. They will then dream of their future
husbands, or if perchance one of them is destined to lead apes, she will
dream of wandering by herself over crags and mountains.</p>
<p>On the 28th of the same month, another divination is practised by the
paring of an apple, which is taken by a girl in the right hand, who
recites the following lines, standing in the middle of a room—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">St. Simon and Jude, on you I intrude,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">By this paring I hold to discover,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Without any delay, to tell me this day</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The first letter of my own true lover.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>She must then turn round three times, casting the paring over her left
shoulder, and it will form the first letter of her husband's name; but
if the paring breaks into many pieces so that no letter is discernible,
she will never marry. The pips of the apple must then be placed in cold
spring water, and eaten by the girl; but for what further object my
deponent sayeth not.</p>
<p>A very singular divination practised at the period of the harvest-moon
is thus described in an old chap-book. When you go to bed, place under
your pillow a prayer-book open at the part of the matrimonial service,
&quot;With this ring I thee wed;&quot; place on it a key, a ring, a flower, and a
sprig of willow, a small heart-cake, a crust of bread, and the following
cards:—the ten of clubs, nine of hearts, ace of spades, and the ace of
diamonds. Wrap all these in a thin handkerchief of gauze or muslin, and
on getting into bed, cross your hands, and say—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Luna, every woman's friend,</div>
<div class="line">To me thy goodness condescend;</div>
<div class="line">Let me this night in visions see</div>
<div class="line">Emblems of my destiny.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>If you dream of storms, trouble will betide you; if the storm ends in a
fine calm, so will your fate; if of a ring or the ace of diamonds,
marriage; bread, an industrious life; cake, a prosperous life; flowers,
joy; willow, treachery in love; spades, death; diamonds, money; clubs, a
foreign land; hearts, illegitimate children; keys, that you will rise to
great trust and power, and never know want; birds, that you will have
many children; and geese, that you will marry more than once.</p>
<p>In Dorsetshire, the girls have a method of divination with their shoes
for obtaining dreams of their future husbands. At night, on going to
bed, a girl places her shoes at right angles to one another, in the form
of a T, saying—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Hoping this night my true love to see,</div>
<div class="line">I place my shoes in the form of a T.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>On St. Luke's day, says Mother Bunch, take marigold flowers, a sprig of
marjoram, thyme, and a little wormwood; dry them before a fire, rub them
to powder; then sift it through a fine piece of lawn, and simmer it over
a slow fire, adding a small quantity of virgin honey, and vinegar.
Anoint yourself with this when you go to bed, saying the following lines
three times, and you will dream of your partner &quot;that is to be:&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">St. Luke, St. Luke, be kind to me,</div>
<div class="line">In dreams let me my true love see.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>If a girl desires to obtain this information, let her seek for a green
peascod in which there are full nine peas, and write on a piece of
paper—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Come in, my dear,</div>
<div class="line">And do not fear;</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>which paper she must inclose in the peascod, and lay it under the door.
The first person who comes into the room will be her husband. Does
Shakespeare allude to some notion of this kind by the wooing of a
peascod in As You Like It, ii. 4?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="st-agnes-night">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id268">ST. AGNES' NIGHT.</a></h2>
<p>&quot;The women have several magical secrets handed down to them by
tradition, as on St. Agnes' night, 21st January. Take a row of pins, and
pull out every one, one after another, saying a Pater Noster, sticking a
pin in your sleeve, and you will dream of him or her you shall marry.
You must lie in another county, and knit the left garter about the
right-legg'd stockin (let the other garter and stockin alone), and as
you rehearse these following verses, at every comma knit a knot:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This knot I knit</div>
<div class="line">To know the thing I know not yet:</div>
<div class="line">That I may see</div>
<div class="line">The man that shall my husband be,</div>
<div class="line">How he goes and what he wears,</div>
<div class="line">And what he does all the days.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly in your dream you will see him, if a musician with a lute or
other instrument, if a scholar, with a book, &amp;c. A gentlewoman that I
knew confessed in my hearing, that she used this method, and dreamt of
her husband whom she had never seen. About two or three years after, as
she was on Sunday at church, up pops a young Oxonian in the pulpit. She
cries out presently to her sister, 'This is the very face of the man
that I saw in my dream.'&quot;—Aubrey's Miscellanies, ed. 1696, p. 105.</p>
<p>On St. Agnes' day, take a sprig of rosemary, and another of thyme, and
sprinkle them thrice with water. In the evening put one in each shoe,
placing a shoe on each side of the bed, and when you retire to rest, say
the following lines, and your future husband will appear &quot;visible to
sight:&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">St. Agnes, that's to lovers kind,</div>
<div class="line">Come ease the trouble of my mind.</div>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kale">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id269">KALE.</a></h2>
<p>The young women of some districts in the North of England have a method
of divination by <em>kale</em> or broth, which is used for the purpose of
learning who are to be their future husbands. The plan followed is this.
The maiden at bedtime stands <em>on something on which she never stood
before</em>, holding a pot of cold kale in her hand, and repeating the
following lines. She then drinks nine times, goes to bed backwards, and
of course dreams of her partner:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Hot kale or cold kale, I drink thee;</div>
<div class="line">If ever I marry a man, or a man marry me,</div>
<div class="line">I wish this night I may him see,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To-morrow may him ken</div>
</div>
<div class="line">In church, fair, or market,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Above all other men.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>On Valentine's day take two bay leaves, sprinkle them with rose-water,
and lay them across your pillow in the evening. When you go to bed, put
on a clean nightgown turned wrong side outwards, and, lying down, say
these words softly to yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Good Valentine, be kind to me,</div>
<div class="line">In dreams let me my true love see.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>After this go to sleep as soon as you can, and you will see in a dream
your future husband.</p>
<p>Schoolboys have several kinds of divination-verses on going to bed, now
repeated &quot;more in mock than mark,&quot; but no doubt originating in serious
belief—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Go to bed first,</div>
<div class="line">A golden purse;</div>
<div class="line">Go to bed second,</div>
<div class="line">A golden pheasant;</div>
<div class="line">Go to bed third,</div>
<div class="line">A golden bird.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The positions they occupy in the bed are suggestive of the following
fortunes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">He that lies at the stock,</div>
<div class="line">Shall have the gold rock;</div>
<div class="line">He that lies at the wall,</div>
<div class="line">Shall have the gold ball;</div>
<div class="line">He that lies in the middle,</div>

<p>And this is probably correct, for we appear to have formed this method
of divination in some indirect manner from a custom still prevalent in
Germany of addressing the cuckoo, when he is first heard, with a view of
ascertaining the duration of life, by counting the number of times it
repeats its note. The lines used on this occasion are given by Grimm:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Kukuk, Beckerknecht!</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Sag mir recht,</div>

</blockquote>
<p>An old story is told of a man who was on his road towards a monastery,
which he was desirous of entering as a monk for the salvation of his
soul, and hearing the cuckoo, stopped to count the number of notes. They
were twenty-two. &quot;Oh!&quot; said he, &quot;since I shall be sure to live
twenty-two years, what is the use of mortifying myself in a monastery
all that time? I'll e'en go and live merrily for twenty years, and it
will be all in good time to betake me to a monastery for the other two.&quot;
See Wright's Essays, i. 257; and Latin Stories, p. 42, de cuculo; p. 74,
de muliere in extremis quæ dixit <em>kuckuc</em>. Both these tales curiously
illustrate the extent to which faith in the divination extended.</p>
<p>If a maid desires to attach the affections of her lover unalterably to
her, she must wait till she finds him asleep with his clothes on. She
must then take away one of his garters without his perceiving it, and
tie it to her own in a true-love knot, saying—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

<p>In many parts of the country, it is considered extremely unlucky to give

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This even-ash I hold in my hand,</div>
<div class="line">The first I meet is my true man.</div>

<p>She carries it in her hand a short distance, and if she meets a young
man, he will be her future husband. If not, she must put the leaf in her
glove, and say—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This even-ash I hold in my glove,</div>
<div class="line">The first I meet is my true love.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>She carries it in her glove a short time, with the same intention as
before, but if she meets no one, she places the leaf in her bosom,
saying—</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This even-ash I hold in my bosom,</div>

<p>This plant, in the eastern counties, is termed <em>yarroway</em>, and there is
a curious mode of divination with its serrated leaf, with which you must
tickle the inside of your nose, repeating the following lines. If the
operation causes the nose to bleed, it is a certain omen of success:</p>

<p>Another mode of divination with this plant caused a dream of a future
husband. An ounce of yarrow, sewed up in flannel, must be placed under
your pillow when you go to bed, and having repeated the following words,
the required dream will be realized:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Accordingly at the end of the nine days, or shortly afterwards, he will
ask for something to put to a wound he will have met with during the

object. On a Friday morning, fasting, write on four pieces of paper the
names of three persons you like best, and also the name of Death, fold
them up, wear them in your bosom all day, and at night shake them up in
your left shoe, going to bed backwards; take out one with your left
hand, and the other with your right, throw three of them out of the
shoe, and in the morning whichever name remains in the shoe is that of
your future husband. If Death is left, you will not marry any of them.</p>

<p>The herb vervain was formerly held of great efficacy against witchcraft,

her in the shape of a handsome young man:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>By his repugnance to these sacred plants, his mistress discovered the
cloven foot. Many ceremonies were used in gathering it. &quot;You must
observe,&quot; says Gerard, &quot;Mother Bumbies rules to take just so many knots
or sprigs, and no more, least it fall out so that it do you no good, if
you catch no harme by it; many odde olde wives' fables are written of
vervaine, tending to witchcraft and sorcerie, which you may reade
elsewhere, for I am not willing to trouble your eares with reporting
such trifles as honest eares abhorre to heare.&quot; An old English poem on
the virtue of herbs, of the fourteenth century, says:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>A magical MS. in the Chetham Library at Manchester, of the time of Queen
Elizabeth, furnishes us with a poetical prayer used in gathering this
herb:</p>

<p>Two hogsheads full of money were concealed in a subterraneous vault at
Penyard Castle, in Herefordshire. A farmer undertook to drag them from
their hiding-place, a matter of no small difficulty, for they were
protected by preternatural power. To accomplish his object, he took
twenty steers to draw down the iron doors of the vault in which the
hogsheads were deposited. The door was partially opened, and a jackdaw
was seen perched on one of the casks. The farmer was overjoyed at the
prospect of success, and as soon as he saw the casks, he exclaimed, &quot;I
believe I shall have it.&quot; The door immediately closed with a loud clang,
and a voice in the air exclaimed—</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There is a superstition, says Forby, ii. 411, respecting cutting the
nails, and some days are considered more lucky for this operation than
others. To cut them on a Tuesday is thought particularly auspicious.
Indeed if we are to believe an old rhyming saw on this subject, every
day of the week is endowed with its several and peculiar virtue, if the
nails are invariably cut on that day and no other. The lines are as
follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Cut them on Monday, you cut them for health;</div>
<div class="line">Cut them on Tuesday, you cut them for wealth;</div>
<div class="line">Cut them on Wednesday, you cut them for news;</div>
<div class="line">Cut them on Thursday, a new pair of shoes;</div>
<div class="line">Cut them on Friday, you cut them for sorrow;</div>
<div class="line">Cut them on Saturday, see your true love to-morrow;</div>
<div class="line">Cut them on Sunday, the devil will be with you all the week.</div>

<p>The following divination-rhymes refer to the <em>gifts</em>, or white spots on

<div class="line">The Man in the Moon</div>
<div class="line">Sups his sowins with a cutty-spoon.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>A Northumberland dish called <em>sowins</em>, is composed of the coarse parts
of oatmeal, which are put into a tub, and covered with water, and then
allowed to stand till it turns sour. A portion of it is then taken out,
and sapped with milk. It may easily be imagined that this is a substance
not very accessible to the movements of a cutty or very small spoon.</p>
<p>Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, p. 412, informs us that there are three
legends connected with the Man in the Moon; the first, that this
personage was Isaac carrying a bundle of sticks for his own sacrifice;
the second, that he was Cain; and the other, which is taken from the
history of the Sabbath-breaker, as related in the Book of Numbers. The
last is still generally current in this country, and is alluded to by
Chaucer, and many early writers. The second is mentioned by Dante,
Inferno, xx., Cain sacrificing to the Lord <em>thorns</em>, the most wretched
production of the ground,—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">——chè già tiene 'l confine</div>

<div class="line">D'amenduo gli emisperi, e tocca l'onda</div>
<div class="line">Sotto Sibilia, Caino e le spine.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears that sowins were not the only food of the lunary inhabitant,
for it is related by children he once favoured middle-earth with his
presence, and took a fancy to some pease-porridge, which he was in such
a hurry to devour that he scalded his mouth:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">

<div class="line">Came tumbling down,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And asked his way to Norwich;</div>

<div class="line">He went by the south,</div>
<div class="line">And burnt his mouth</div>
</div>
<div class="line">With supping hot pease-porridge.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>His chief beverage, as everybody knows, was claret:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The Man in the Moon drinks claret,</div>
<div class="line">But he is a dull Jack-a-Dandy;</div>

<p>It is greatly to be feared that, notwithstanding the efforts made within
the last few years by individuals who have desired to see the
resuscitation of the merry sports and customs of old England, the spirit
which formerly characterised them is not to be recovered. The mechanical
spirit of the age has thrown a degree of ridicule over observances which
have not been without use in their day; and might even now be rendered
beneficial to the public, were it possible to exclude the influence
which tells the humbler subject such matters are below his regard. Yet
it must be confessed that most of our ancient customs are only suited to
the thinly-populated rural districts, where charity, goodwill, and
friendship may be delicately cultivated under the plea of their
observance.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id284">VALENTINE'S DAY.</a></h2>
<p>In the western counties, the children, decked with the wreaths and
true-lover's knots presented to them, gaily adorn one of their number
as their chief, and march from house to house, singing—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Good morrow to you, Valentine!</div>
<div class="line">Curl your locks as I do mine;</div>
<div class="line">Two before and three behind;</div>
<div class="line">Good morrow to you, Valentine!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>They commence in many places as early as six o'clock in the morning, and
intermingle the cry, &quot;To-morrow is come!&quot; Afterwards they make merry
with their collections. At Islip, co. Oxon, I have heard the children
sing the following when collecting pence on this day:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Good morrow, Valentine!</div>
<div class="line">I be thine and thou be'st mine,</div>
<div class="line">So please give me a Valentine!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>And likewise the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Good morrow, Valentine,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">God bless you ever!</div>
</div>

<div class="line">Old England for ever!</div>

</blockquote>
<p>Schoolboys have a very uncomplimentary way of presenting each other with
these poetical memorials:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Peep, fool, peep,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">What do you think to see?</div>
</div>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And here's one for thee!</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Far different from this is a stanza which is a great favorite with young
girls on this day, offered indiscriminately, and of course quite
innocently, to most of their acquaintances:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The rose is red,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The violet's blue;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Pinks are sweet,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And so are you!</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The mission of valentines is one of the very few old customs not on the
wane; and the streets of our metropolis practically bear evidence of
this fact in the distribution of love-messages on our stalls and
shop-windows, varying in price from a sovereign to one halfpenny. Our
readers, no doubt, will ask for its origin, and there we are at fault to
begin with. The events of St. Valentine's life furnish no clue whatever
to the mystery, although Wheatley, in his Illustration of the Common
Prayer, absurdly disposes of the question in this way: &quot;St. Valentine
was a man of most admirable parts, and so famous for his love and
charity, that the custom of choosing valentines upon his festival, which
is still practised, took its rise from thence.&quot; We see no explanation
here in any way satisfactory, and must be contented with the hope that
some of our antiquaries may hit on something more to the purpose.</p>
<p>Valentine's day has long been popularly believed to be the day on which
birds pair. Shakespeare alludes to this belief:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Good morrow, friends: St. Valentine is past;</div>
<div class="line">Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It was anciently the custom to draw lots on this day. The names of an
equal number of each sex were put into a box, in separate partitions,
out of which every one present drew a name, called the valentine, which
was regarded as a good omen of their future marriage. It would appear
from a curious passage quoted in my Dictionary of Archaisms, that any
lover was hence termed a valentine; not necessarily an affianced lover,
as suggested in Hampson's Calendarium, vol. i. p. 163. Lydgate, the poet
of Bury, in the fifteenth century, thus mentions this practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

<p>Gay alludes to another popular notion referring to the same day:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Last Valentine, the day when birds of kind</div>
<div class="line">Their paramours with mutual chirpings find,</div>
<div class="line">I early rose, just at the break of day,</div>

<div class="line">Afield I went, amid the burning dew,</div>
<div class="line">To milk my kine, for so should housewives do.</div>
<div class="line">Thee first I spied; and the first swain we see,</div>
<div class="line">In spite of fortune shall our true love be.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The divinations practised on Valentine's day is a curious subject.
Herrick mentions one by rose-buds:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">She must no more a-maying;</div>
<div class="line">Or by rose-buds divine</div>
<div class="line">Who'll be her valentine.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the poet may here allude to a practice similar to the following,
quoted by Brand: &quot;Last Friday was Valentine day; and the night before I
got five bay-leaves, and pinned four of them to the four corners of my
pillow, and the fifth to the middle; and then, if I dreamt of my
sweetheart, Betty said we should be married before the year was out.
<em>But to make it more sure</em> I boiled an egg hard, and took out the yolk,
and filled it with salt; and when I went to bed, eat it shell and all,
without speaking or drinking after it. We also wrote our lovers' names
upon bits of paper, and rolled them up in clay, and put them into water;
and the first that rose up was to be our valentine. Would you think it?
Mr. Blossom was my man. I lay abed, and shut my eyes all the morning,
till he came to our house, for I would not have seen another man before
him for all the world.&quot; According to Mother Bunch, the following lines
should be said by the girl on retiring to rest the previous night:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Sweet guardian angels, let me have</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">What I most earnestly do crave,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">A valentine endow'd with love,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">That will both kind and constant prove.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>We believe the old custom of drawing lots on this eventful day is
obsolete, and has given place to the favorite practice of sending
pictures, with poetical legends, to objects of love or ridicule. The
lower classes, however, seldom treat the matter with levity, and many
are the offers of marriage thus made. The clerks at the post-offices are
to be pitied, the immense increase of letters beyond the usual average
adding very inconveniently to their labours.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id285">YOULING.</a></h2>
<p>In Rogation week there is or was an odd custom in the country about
Keston and Wickham, in Kent. A number of young men meet together for the
purpose, and, with a most hideous noise, run into the orchards, and,
encircling each tree, pronounce these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Stand fast, root; bear well, top;</div>
<div class="line">God send us a youling sop!</div>
<div class="line">E'ry twig, apple big;</div>
<div class="line">E'ry bough, apple enow.</div>
<div class="line">Hats full, caps full,</div>
<div class="line">Full quarter sacks full.</div>

</blockquote>
<p>For this incantation the confused rabble expect a gratuity in money, or
drink, which is no less welcome; but if they are disappointed in both,
they, with great solemnity, anathematize the owners and trees with
altogether as insignificant a curse.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems highly probable,&quot; says Hasted, in his History of Kent, &quot;that
this custom has arisen from the ancient one of perambulation among the
heathens, when they made their prayers to the gods, for the use and
blessing of the fruits coming up, with thanksgiving for those of the
preceding year; and as the heathens supplicated Eolus, the god of the
winds, for his favorable blasts, so in this custom they still retain his
name, with a very small variation, the ceremony being called <em>yeuling</em>;
and the word is often used in their invocations.&quot;</p>

<div class="section" id="boy-s-bailiff">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id286">BOY'S BAILIFF.</a></h2>
<p>An old custom, formerly in vogue at Wenlock, in Shropshire, thus
described by Mr. Collins: &quot;I am old enough to remember an old custom,
and the last time it took place was about sixty years ago; it was called
the 'boy's bailiff,' and was held in the Easter week, Holy Thursday, or
in Whitsun week, and I have no doubt was for the purpose of going a
bannering the extensive boundaries of this franchise, which consists of
eighteen parishes. It consisted of a man, who wore a hair-cloth gown,
and was called the bailiff, a recorder, justices, town-clerk, sheriff,
treasurer, crier, and other municipal officers. They were a large
retinue of men and boys mounted on horseback, begirt with wooden swords,
which they carried on their right sides, so that they must draw the
swords out of the scabbards with their left hands. They, when I knew
them, did not go the boundary, but used to call at all the gentlemen's
houses in the franchise, where they were regaled with meat, drink, and
money; and before the conclusion they assembled at the pillory, at the
guildhall, where the town-clerk read some sort of rigmarole which they
called their charter, and I remember one part was—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">We go from Bickbury and Badger to Stoke on the Clee,</div>
<div class="line">To Monkhopton, Round Acton, and so return we.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Bickbury, Badger, and Stoke on the Clee, were and are the two extreme
points of the franchise, north and south; Monkhopton and Round Acton are
two other parishes on the return from Stoke St. Millborough, otherwise
Stoke on the Clee (or perhaps Milburga, the tutelar saint of the Abbey
of Wenlock), to Much Wenlock. This custom I conceive to have originated
in going a bannering, unless it should have been got up as a mockery to
the magistracy of the franchise; but I rather think the former.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pace-egging">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id287">PACE-EGGING.</a></h2>
<p>It is a custom in some parts of England for boys to go round the village
on Easter eve begging for eggs or money, and a sort of dramatic song is
sometimes used on the occasion. The following copy was taken down from
recitation some years ago in the neighbourhood of York; but in another
version we find Lords Nelson and Collingwood introduced, by a practice
of adaptation to passing events, which is fortunately not extensively
followed in such matters. A boy, representing a captain, enters and
sings—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Here's two or three jolly boys all o' one mind,</div>
<div class="line">We've come a pace-egging, and hope you'll be kind;</div>
<div class="line">I hope you'll be kind with your eggs and your beer,</div>
<div class="line">And we'll come no more pace-egging until the next year.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Then old Toss-pot enters, and the captain, pointing him out, says—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The first that comes in is old Toss-pot you see,</div>
<div class="line">A valiant old blade for his age and degree;</div>
<div class="line">He is a brave fellow on hill or in dale,</div>
<div class="line">And all he delights in is a-drinking of ale.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Toss-pot then pretends to take a long draught from a huge quart-pot,
and, reeling about, tries to create laughter by tumbling over as many
boys as he can. A miser next enters, who is generally a boy dressed up
as an old woman in tattered rags, with his face blackened. He is thus
introduced by the captain:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">An old miser's the next that comes in with her bags,</div>
<div class="line">And to save up her money, wears nothing but rags.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line"><em>Chorus.</em> Whatever you give us we claim for our right,</div>
<div class="line">Then bow with our heads, and wish you good night.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This is repeated twice, and the performance concludes by the whole
company shouting to the top of their voice—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Now, ye ladies and gentlemen, who sit by the fire,</div>
<div class="line">Put your hands in your pockets, 'tis all we desire;</div>
<div class="line">Put your hands in your pockets, and lug out your purse,</div>
<div class="line">We shall be the better, you'll be none the worse!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Pase-day, Easter-day. Pase-eggs, Easter-eggs. Corrupt. from Pasch. They
have a proverbial rhyme in those parts for the Sundaies in Lent:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id289">ISLE OF WIGHT SHROVERS.</a></h2>
<p>Until within about the last thirty years, it had been the custom in the
Isle of Wight from time immemorial at all the farms and some other
charitable houses to distribute cakes on Shrove-Tuesday, called
Shrove-cakes, to the poor children of the parish or neighbourhood, who
assembled early in the morning at the different villages, hamlets, and
cottages, in parties of from two to thirty or more, for the purpose of
what was denominated &quot;Going Shroving,&quot; and the children bore the name of
<em>Shrovers</em>. At every house they visited they had a nice Shrove-cake each
given them. In those days the winters were much more inclement and of
longer duration than at the present time, and it often happened that, in
addition to a severe frost, the ground was covered several inches high
with snow, yet however cold or intense the weather, it did not prevent
these little ones from what they called in the provincial dialect
<em>Gwine a Shrovun</em>, and they jogged merrily along hand in hand from one
house to another to obtain their cakes; but, before receiving them, it
was expected and deemed necessary that they should all sing together a
song suitable to the occasion; those who <em>sang the loudest</em> were
considered the <em>best Shrovers</em>, and sometimes had an extra cake bestowed
on them; consequently, there was no want of noise (whatever there might
have been of harmony) to endeavour to get another Shroving gift. There
were many different versions of the song according to the parishes they
lived in. The one generally sang by the children of the East Medina was
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A Shrovun, a Shrovun,</div>

<p>If the song was not given sufficiently loud, they were desired to sing
it again. In that case it very rarely required a second repetition. When
the Shrovers were more numerous than was anticipated, it not
unfrequently happened that, before the time of the arrival of the latter
parties, the Shrove-cakes had been expended; then dough-nuts, pancakes,
bread and cheese, or bread and bacon, were given, or halfpence were
substituted; but in <em>no instance</em> whatever were they sent from the door
empty-handed. It is much to be regretted that this charitable custom
should have become almost extinct; there being very few houses at the
present time where they distribute Shrove-cakes.</p>
<p id="remnant">&quot;There was another very ancient custom somewhat similar to the Shroving,
which has also nearly, if not quite, disappeared; probably it began to
decay within the last half-century: this was a gift of cakes and ale to
children on <em>New Year's Day</em>, who, like the Shrovers, went from house to
house singing for them; but, if we may judge from the song, those
children were for the most part from the towns and larger villages, as
the song begins, &quot;<em>A sale, a sale in our town</em>;&quot; there is no doubt but
it was written for the occasion some centuries since, when &quot;a sale&quot; was
not a thing of such a common occurrence as now, and when there was one,
it was often held in an open field in or near the town.&quot; So writes my
kind and valued correspondent, Captain Henry Smith, but <em>town</em> is, I
think, merely a provincialism for <em>village</em>. It is so, at least, in the
North of England. As for the phrase <em>a seyal</em>, it seems to be a
<a class="reference internal" href="#corruption-of">corruption of</a> <em>wassail</em>, the original sense having been lost. The
following was the song:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

door with stones, because not open to hospitality. Then the assailant
would run away, be followed and caught, and brought back again as
prisoner, and had to undergo the punishment of roasting the shoe. This
consisted in an old shoe being hung up before the fire, which the
culprit was obliged to keep in a constant whirl, roasting himself as
well as the shoe, till some damsel took compassion on him, and let him
go; in this case he was to treat her with a little present at the next

<p>The custom of making fools on the 1st of April is one of the few old
English merriments still in general vogue. We used to say on the
occasion of having entrapped any one—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

<div class="line">You learn nought by going to school!</div>

<p>The legitimate period only extends to noon, and if any one makes an
April-fool after that hour, the boy on whom the attempt is made, retorts
with the distich—</p>

<p>This is the Oxfordshire song chanted by the boys when collecting sticks
for the bonfire, and it is considered quite lawful to appropriate any
old wood they can lay their hands on after the recitation of these
lines. If it happen that a crusty chuff prevents them, the threatening
finale is too often fulfilled. The operation is called <em>going a
progging</em>, but whether this is a mere corruption of <em>prigging</em>, or
whether <em>progging</em> means collecting sticks (<em>brog</em>, Scot. Bor.), I am
unable to decide. In some places they shout, previously to the burning
of the effigy of Guy Fawkes—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">

<p>The metropolis and its neighbourhood are still annually visited by
subdued vestiges of the old customs of the bonfire-day. Numerous parties
of boys parade the streets with effigies of Guy Fawkes, but pence, not
antipopery, is the object of the exhibition, and the evening fires have
generally been exchanged for the mischievous practice of annoying
passengers with squibs and crackers. The spirit and necessity of the
display have expired, and the lover of old customs had better be
contented to hear of it in history; even although the special service
for the day, still retained in our Prayer-book, may tend to recognise
the propriety of external rejoicings.</p>

<div class="line">As much in mock as mark.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Steevens and Henley, in their notes on Shakespeare, bear testimony to
the fact that barbers were accustomed to expose in their shops a list of
forfeits for misbehaviour, which were &quot;as much in mock as mark,&quot;
because the barber had no authority of himself to enforce them, and they
were in some respects of a ludicrous nature. &quot;Barbers' forfeits,&quot; says
Forby, in his Vocabulary of East Anglia, p. 119, &quot;exist to this day in
some, perhaps in many, village shops. They are penalties for handling
the razors, &amp;c., offences very likely to be committed by lounging
clowns, waiting for their turn to be scraped on a Saturday night or
Sunday morning. They are still, as of old, 'more in mock than mark.'
Certainly more mischief might be done two hundred years ago, when the
barber was also a surgeon.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Kenrick <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id119" id="id118">[55]</a> was the first to publish a copy of <em>barbers' forfeits</em>,
and, as I do not observe it in any recent edition of Shakespeare, I here

Doctor in Yorkshire:</p>

<p>It is not improbable that these lines had been partly modernized from an
older original before they reached Dr. Kenrick, but Steevens was
certainly too precipitate in pronouncing them to be forgeries. Their
authenticity is placed beyond a doubt by the testimony of my late
friend, Major Moor, who, in his Suffolk Words, p. 133, informs us that
he had seen a version of these rules at the tonsor's, of Alderton, near
the sea.</p>

<p>A very old practice of young women, moving as if they were kneading
dough, and repeating the above lines, which are sometimes varied thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Cockeldy bread, mistley cake,</div>
<div class="line">When you do that for our sake.</div>

</blockquote>
<p>The entire explanation of this, which is not worth giving here, may be
seen in Thoms's Anecdotes and Traditions, p. 95. An allusion to
cockle-bread occurs as early as 1595, in Peele's singular play of the
Old Wives Tale.</p>

<p>These lines are sung by a person at the table after dinner. His next
neighbour then sings &quot;Once so merrily hopped she,&quot; during which the
first singer is obliged to drink a bumper; and should he be unable to
empty his glass before the last line is sung, he must begin again till
he succeeds. The next line is &quot;Twice so merrily hopped she,&quot; sung by the
next person under a similar arrangement, and so on; beginning again
after &quot;Thrice so merrily hopped she, heigh ho! heigh ho! heigh ho!&quot; till
the ceremony has been repeated around the table. It is to be hoped so
absurd a practice is not now in fashion.</p>
<p>When a boy finds anything, and another sees him stoop for it, if the
latter cries <em>halves</em> before he has picked it up, he is, by schoolboy
law, entitled to half of it. This right may, however, be negatived, if
the finder cries out first—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Ricket, racket, find it, tack it,</div>

<div class="line">Lossee, seekee.</div>

<p>The earliest and simplest form in which the nursery song appears is the
lullaby, which may be defined a gentle song used for the purpose of
inducing sleep. The term was generally, though not exclusively, confined
to nurses:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Philomel, with melody</div>
<div class="line">Sing in our sweet lullaby;</div>
<div class="line">Lulla, lulla, lullaby;</div>
<div class="line">Lulla, lulla, lullaby.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The etymology is to be sought for in the verb <em>lull</em>, to sing gently,
which Douce thinks is connected with λαλεω or λάλλη.
One of the earliest nursery lullabies that have descended to our day
occurs in the play of Philotimus, 1583:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Trylle the ball againe my Jacke,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And be contente to make some play,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And I will lull thee on my lappe,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">With hey be bird now say not nay.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Another is introduced into the comedy of Patient Grissel, printed in the
year 1603:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Hush, hush, hush, hush!</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And I dance mine own child,</div>
<div class="line">And I dance mine own child,</div>

<div class="section" id="billy-my-son">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id302">BILLY, MY SON.</a></h2>
<p>The following lines are very common in the English nursery, and resemble
the popular German ditty of Grandmother Addercook, inserted in the
Knaben Wunderhorn, and translated by Dr. Jamieson in the Illustrations
of Northern Antiquities. The ballad of the Crowden Doo, Chambers, p.
205, bears, however, a far greater similarity to the German song.
Compare, also, the ballad of Willie Doo, in Buchan's Ancient Songs, ii.
179.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Where have you been to-day, Billy, my son?</div>
<div class="line">Where have you been to-day, my only man?</div>
<div class="line">I've been a wooing, mother, make my bed soon,</div>
<div class="line">For I'm sick at heart, and fain would lay down.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">What have you ate to-day, Billy, my son?</div>
<div class="line">What have you ate to-day, my only man?</div>
<div class="line">I've ate eel-pie, mother, make my bed soon,</div>
<div class="line">For I'm sick at heart, and shall die before noon.</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It is said there is some kind of a fairy legend connected with these
lines, Billy having probably been visited by his mermaid mother. Nothing
at all satisfactory has, however, yet been produced. It appears to bear
a slight analogy to the old ballad, &quot;Where have you been all the day, my
boy Willie,&quot; printed from a version obtained from Suffolk, in the
Nursery Rhymes of England, p. 146; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id124" id="id123">[57]</a> and on this account we may here
insert a copy of the pretty Scottish ballad, Tammy's Courtship:</p>

<p>The ballad of Lord Randal, printed by Sir Walter Scott, may, after all,
furnish the true solution to the meaning of our nursery rhyme, and I am
therefore induced to insert a version of it still popular in Scotland,
in which the hero of the song is styled Laird Rowland:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Ah! where have you been, Lairde Rowlande, my son?</div>
<div class="line">Ah! where have you been, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I've been in the wild-woods,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Mither, mak my bed soon,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">For I'm weary wi' hunting,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And faine would lie down.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Oh! you've been at your true love's, Lairde Rowlande, my son!</div>
<div class="line">Oh! you've been at your true love's, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I've been at my true love's,</div>

<div class="line">Mither, mak my bed soon,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">For I'm weary wi' hunting,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And faine would lie down.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line">What got you to dinner, Lairde Rowlande, my son?</div>
<div class="line">What got you to dinner, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">I got eels boil'd in brue,</div>

<div class="line">Mither, mak my bed soon,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">For I'm weary wi' hunting,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And faine would lie down.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line">What's become of your Warden, Lairde Rowlande, my son?</div>
<div class="line">What's become of your Warden, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">He died in the muirlands,</div>

<div class="line">What's become of your stag-hounds, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">They swelled and they died!</div>

</div>
<div class="line">For I'm weary wi' hunting,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And faine would lie down.</div>
</div>
</div>

</blockquote>
<p>The fable or plot of this seems to be, that Lord Rowlande, upon a visit
at the castle of his mistress, has been poisoned by the drugged viands
at the table of her father, who was averse to her marriage with the
lord. Finding himself weary, and conscious that he is poisoned, he
returns to his home, and wishes to retire to his chamber without raising
in his mother any suspicions of the state of his body and mind. This may
be gathered from his short and evasive answers, and the importunate
entreaties with which he requests his mother to prepare his chamber.</p>
<p>In Swedish there are two distinct versions: one, the Child's Last
Wishes, in Geijer and Afzelius, iii. 13, beginning—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Hvar har du varit så länge,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Dotter, liten kind?</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jag har varit hos min Amma,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Kär styf-moder min!</div>
</div>
<div class="line">För aj aj! ondt hafver jag—jag!</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Where hast thou been so long now,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">My sweet wee little child?</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Sure with my nurse I've tarried,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">My own step-mother mild!</div>
</div>
<div class="line">For oh! oh! sore pains have I—I!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The second is in Afzelius, ii. 90, under the same title, and
beginning—</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Hvar har du va't så länge,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Lilla dotter kind?</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jag har va't i Bänne,</div>
<div class="line">Hos broderen min!</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Aj, aj, ondt hafver jag, jag!</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">Where hast thou been so long now,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Wee little daughter fine?</div>
</div>
<div class="line">In Bänne have I tarried,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">With brother mine!</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Oh! oh! sore pains have I—I!</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Both are sung to exquisitely melancholy melodies.</p>
<p>Dr. Jamieson makes some very just observations on this ballad, and the
importance of tracing this class of tales. &quot;That any of the Scotch,
English, and German copies of the same tale have been borrowed or
translated from another, seems very improbable; and it would now be in
vain to attempt to ascertain what it originally was, or in what age it
was produced. It has had the good fortune in every country to get
possession of the nursery, a circumstance which, from the enthusiasm and
curiosity of young imaginations, and the communicative volubility of
little tongues, has insured its preservation. Indeed, many curious
relics of past times are preserved in the games and rhymes found amongst
children, which are on that account by no means beneath the notice of
the curious traveller, who will be surprised to find, after the lapse of
so many ages, and so many changes of place, language, and manners, how
little these differ among different nations of the same original stock,
who have been so long divided and estranged from each other.&quot;</p>

<p>An inferior version of the following, which was obtained from Essex, is

A Swedish version, or rather a variation, in Lilja, p. 17, commences as

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id304">JACK SPRAT.</a></h2>
<p>Fragments of this tale are common in the nursery, but I have only met
with one copy of the following poem, which appears to be of some
antiquity, although it is here printed from a modern chap-book:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Jack Sprat could eat no fat,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">His wife could eat no lean,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And so between them both,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">They licked the platter clean.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jack eat all the lean,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Joan eat all the fat,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">The bone they picked clean,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Then gave it to the cat.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">When Jack Sprat was young,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">He dressed very smart,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">He courted Joan Cole,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And he gained her heart.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">In his fine leather doublet,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And old greasy hat,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Oh, what a smart fellow</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Was little Jack Sprat!</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Joan Cole had a hole</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In her petticoat,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jack Sprat, to get a patch,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Gave her a groat;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">The groat bought a patch,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Which stopped the hole,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">&quot;I thank you, Jack Sprat,&quot;</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Says little Joan Cole.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jack Sprat was the bridegroom,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Joan Cole was the bride,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jack said, from the church,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">His Joan home should ride.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">But no coach could take her,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The lane was so narrow,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Said Jack, then I'll take her</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Home in a wheelbarrow.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jack Sprat was wheeling</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">His wife by the ditch,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">The barrow turned over,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And in she did pitch;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Says Jack, she'll be drown'd,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But Joan did reply,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">I don't think I shall,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For the ditch is quite dry.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jack brought home his Joan,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And she sat in a chair,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">When in came his cat,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">That had got but one ear.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Says Joan, I'm come home, Puss,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Pray, how do you do?</div>
</div>
<div class="line">The cat wagg'd her tail,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And said nothing but &quot;mew.&quot;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jack Sprat took his gun,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And went to the brook,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">He shot at the drake,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But he killed the duck.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">He brought it to Joan,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Who a fire did make</div>
</div>
<div class="line">To roast the fat duck,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">While Jack went for the drake.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">The drake was swimming</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">With his curly tail,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jack Sprat came to shoot him,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But happened to fail;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">He let off his gun,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">But missing his mark,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">The drake flew away,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Crying, &quot;Quack, quack, quack.&quot;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jack Sprat to live pretty,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Now bought him a pig,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">It was not very little,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">It was not very big;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">It was not very lean,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">It was not very fat,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">It will serve for a grunter</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For little Jack Sprat.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Then Joan went to market</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To buy her some fowls,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">She bought a jackdaw</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And a couple of owls.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">The owls they were white,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The jackdaw was black,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">They'll make a rare breed,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Says little Joan Sprat.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jack Sprat bought a cow,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">His Joan for to please,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">For Joan she could make</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Both butter and cheese;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Or pancakes or puddings,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Without any fat:</div>
</div>
<div class="line">A notable housewife</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Was little Joan Sprat.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Joan Sprat went to brewing</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A barrel of ale,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">She put in some hops</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">That it might not turn stale;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">But as for the malt,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">She forgot to put that,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">This is brave sober liquor,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Said little Jack Sprat.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jack Sprat went to market,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And bought him a mare,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">She was lame of three legs,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And as blind as she could stare;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Her ribs they were bare,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For the mare had no fat,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">She looks like a racer,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Says little Jack Sprat.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Jack and Joan went abroad,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Puss took care of the house,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">She caught a large rat</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And a very small mouse:</div>
</div>
<div class="line">She caught a small mouse,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And a very large rat;</div>
</div>
<div class="line">You're an excellent hunter,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Says little Jack Sprat.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Now I have told you the story</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Of little Jack Sprat,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">And little Joan Cole,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And the poor one-ear'd cat.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Now Jack loved Joan,</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">And good things he taught her,</div>

<div class="line">Then she gave him a son,</div>

<div class="line">Then after a daughter.</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Now Jack has got rich</div>

<p>An immense variety of songs and catches relating to Tommy Linn are known
throughout the country. The air of Thom of Lyn is one of those mentioned
in the Complaynt of Scotland, 1549. See Chambers, p. 192, who gives a
Scotch version of the above song. The song itself is quoted in Wager's
play, 'The longer thou livest the more foole thou art,' written about
the year 1560. Dr. Leyden conjectures that the hero is the same with
Tamlene, who is introduced into a well-known fairy ballad published by
Sir W. Scott.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id139">CONCLUSION.</a></h1>
<p>Our collection of vernacular scraps, which, like the &quot;brave beggars of
Coudingham fair,&quot; have been gathered from the lanes and by-ways, is now
brought to a conclusion. They are, it must be confessed, but literary
vagrants at the best; but they breathe of country freshness, and may
impart some of their spirit to our languishing home-life. The cottage
without its traditional literature is but a poor feature in the
landscape that is loved by the poet. The legend or antique rhyme
emanating from its door expresses a characteristic he would not
willingly see perish. It may be that little of this now remains in
England, but the minutest indications should be carefully chronicled ere
they disappear.</p>
<p>Many of the fragments in the preceding pages are, in fact, rather
indications of what formerly existed than complete specimens of their
class. It is beyond a doubt that, two centuries ago, our rural districts
were rich in all kinds of popular and traditional literature, in legends
and ancient rhymes. Unfortunately, the antiquaries of the old school
considered such matters beneath their notice; and instead of conferring
a very important benefit on literature by preserving them, occupied a
great portion of their time in essays of very questionable utility. It
thus happened that allusions in our old poets, intelligible enough in
those days, became enigmas when the memory of these trifles disappeared.
We should fall into a similar error did we neglect those which still
remain, merely because their value is not always immediately apparent,
or be alarmed at a suggestion that we are &quot;suckling fools, and
chronicling small beer.&quot;</p>
<p>Let us hope the reader may view these trifles with more indulgence, and
enlist his sympathies with our own; for if literary value is insisted
upon as the sole use of their publication, the critic may require an
abler apologist. He may refuse to admit the importance of preserving a
large collection for the sake of the few which may illustrate the works
of our ancient authors. But we trust this opinion will not be general;
that their natural simplicity will compensate in some respects for
deficiency of literary elegance; and that the universal and absorbing
prevalence of one pursuit has not put to flight all kindly memory of the
recreations of a happier age:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The sports of childhood's roseate dawn</div>
<div class="line">Have passed from our hearts like the dew-gems from morn:</div>
<div class="line">We have parted with marbles—we own not a ball,</div>
<div class="line">And are deaf to the hail of a &quot;whoop and a call.&quot;</div>
<div class="line">But there's an old game that we all keep up,</div>
<div class="line">When we've drank much deeper from life's mixed cup;</div>
<div class="line">Youth may have vanished, and manhood come round,</div>
<div class="line">Yet how busy we are on &quot;Tom Tidler's ground</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Looking for gold and silver!&quot;</div>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
